<p>Welcome to Advanced Styling with Responsive Design, taught by Colleen van Lent!</p>

<p>This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of creating responsive 
websites.</p>

<p>What is a responsive site? The easiest answer may be to describe sites that aren't 
responsive. Have you ever visited a site on your phone and the content just seems crammed 
in? You maybe get the idea that the site was designed for a large screen and simply shrunk 
down for the phone. Or even worse, it wasn't shrunk at all and you have to do a lot of 
side-to-side scrolling? Or maybe you have been on a website on your tablet, but a bunch 
of key components are locked and you are forced to go back when you have access to a laptop 
or desktop?</p>

<p>The following are examples of sites that do not use responsive design;</p>

<p><a href="https://irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irs.gov</a></p>

<p>This course is meant for people who are comfortable using HTML and CSS, but want to take the 
first steps to creating a single site that can display a different layout (or "look") on different 
platforms.</p>

<p>There are three common approaches to responsive design.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>The first is to create your own site using fluid measurements and media queries,<br/><br/></li>
  <li>The second is to use an existing framework (such as Bootstrap) that does all of the 
    responsive design for you, and<br><br></li>
  <li>The third is to use a hybrid approach - use a framework in combination with your own 
    responsive code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout the entire course there will be an emphasis on the importance of good habits and 
examples of potential pitfalls. All of the example code is provided to you as a starting place. 
For some learners, this will be sufficient to get a decent base on how responsive design works. 
For other learners however, there is nothing better than when they decide they can write better 
versions of the code.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<h2>Course Site</h2>

<p>All of the reading material you will need to pass this course is contained within Coursera. 
Additional resources may be added as optional material, but everything will be online and free.</p>

<h2>CodePEN</h2>

<p>For the coding content you may want to access my CodePEN account. CodePEN is a website that allows 
you to modify copies of my code. In real time you can see how your changes affect the website we are 
working on. The one issue that some students have with CodePEN is that it doesn't require you to link 
your files together. So, if you want to write the code right on your machine, you will need to know 
how to link the code. Don't worry, I do cover that in class.</p>

<p>Here are links to collections of code for each week/module of this course:</p>

<p>Module/Week 1: 
<a href="http://codepen.io/collection/nmyRWM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Responsive Design - Week One</a></p>

<p>Module/Week 2: 
<a href="http://codepen.io/collection/nYwVkZ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Responsive Design - Week Two</a></p>

<p>Module/Week 3: 
<a href="http://codepen.io/collection/DZQyBr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Responsive Design - Week Three</a></p>

<p>Module/Week 4: 
<a href="http://codepen.io/collection/XkkwBb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Responsive Design - Week Four</a></p>

<p>When you read the modules, you can check the resources section to find a link to any code 
that is used in the lectures.</p>

<p>At the end of many modules, there is HTML &amp; sometimes CSS code. Use this code in CodePEN 
as referenced in that particular week/module. Oftentimes you will see two files, a "starter" 
file and a "complete" file. This way you can start at the same place as me, but still have 
access to the final product.</p>

<h2>Discussion Boards</h2>

<p>The best way to get help is to utilize the discussion boards. I know that this may be new to 
many of you so let me explain how the discussion boards work. We always have one friendly "where 
are you from? /introduce" yourself board where people tend to be social. Other than that, we 
encourage people to use the discussion section that goes with the week/module you are on. Notice 
that I said "use" not "post." We really want to encourage you to read before you post. You will 
often find your question already there. If you don't find your question, make sure to post. There 
are no "stupid" questions. Ever. (Sometimes you may just have found a mistake on my part that I 
will need to fix.)</p>

<h2>Course Slides</h2>

<p>The slides for all of the lectures are now posted. You can find a 
<a href="http://intro-webdesign.com/ResponsiveDesignSlides.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
noreferrer">BIG zip file of PDF and Powerpoint files</a> at the Introduction to Web Development 
with Responsive Design website.</p>

<p>I have also attached the pdf and powerpoint slide for each week/module directly in the 
week/module text themselves. Just look in the Downloads section to view them.</p>

<h2>There are 4 modules in this course</h2>

<p>It used to be the case that everyone viewed webpages on about the same size screen. But with the 
explosion of the use of smartphones to access the Internet, the landscape of design has completely 
changed. People viewing your site will now expect that it will perform regardless of the platform 
(smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer). This ability to respond to any platform is called 
responsive design.</p>

<p>This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as wireframes, fluid 
design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as Bootstrap.</p>

<p>After the course, learners will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explain the mobile-first paradigm and the importance of wireframes in the design phase,<br></li>
  <li>Create sites that behave across a range of platforms, and<br></li>
  <li>Utilize existing design frameworks such as Bootstrap.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the fourth course in the Web Design for Everybody specialization. A basic understanding 
of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class. Additional courses focus on adding 
interactivity with the JavaScript Programming Language and completing a capstone project.</p>

<h3>Media Sizes (in Pixels)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>@media (min-width:320px) </b><span style="font-size:12px;"> { /* smartphones, iPhone, portrait 480x320 phones */ }</span></p>
  <p><b>@media (min-width:481px) </b><span style="font-size:12px;"> { /* portrait e-readers (Nook/Kindle),600 or 640px smaller tablets @ 600 or @ 640 wide. */ }</span></p>
  <p><b>@media (min-width:641px) </b><span style="font-size:12px;"> { /* portrait tablets, portrait iPad, landscape e-readers, landscape 800x480 or 854x480 phones */ }</span></p>
  <p><b>@media (min-width:961px) </b><span style="font-size:12px;"> { /* tablet, landscape iPad, lo-res laptops and desktops */ }</span></p>
  <p><b>@media (min-width:1025px) </b><span style="font-size:12px;">{ /* big landscape tablets, laptops, and desktops */ }</span></p>
  <p><b>@media (min-width:1281px) </b><span style="font-size:12px;">{ /* hi-res laptops and desktops */ }</span></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Week One: Style with Responsive Design</h2>

<p>What does it mean to have responsive design for your site? How can you tell if your 
existing site is responsive? This lesson we will begin with the theories behind the 
"mobile-first paradigm" - the idea that your mobile site should provide everything 
needed, not a pared-down version of a good page. We end the week by taking the first 
concrete step of using fluid measurements in your CSS.</p>

<h2>Week Two: Basic Concepts</h2>

<p>In this module/week (2) you will get a chance to put the theories into practice using media 
queries in your CSS. These queries can automatically detect the size of the browser being used 
to view the page so that you can decide what type of look you want to achieve. There will also 
be a discussion on common practices for designing your different views at various screen sizes 
("viewports").</p>

<h2>Week Three: Use Existing Frameworks</h2>

<p>After every good programmer has put in time creating sites from scratch, it is common to 
utilize existing tools out there. After all, why recreate the wheel? The work you have done 
up to this point will give you the knowledge needed to craft your own unique sites from these 
frameworks. In this lesson (3) we will work with Bootstrap, a framework that uses HTML5, CSS, 
and JavaScript (but don't worry if you have never used JavaScript yourself).</p>

<p>Welcome to introduction to responsive design. In this course, we're going to talk about 
different ways that you can make your website look the best it can possibly look. No matter 
if someone's viewing it on a phone, a laptop or a tablet.</p>

<p>We're really going to cover the basics in this course and help you develop a general 
understanding of what responsive design is and why you need to know it. We're going to 
talk about ways that you can customize your own site without using any special software 
to give it a really special look and feel.</p>

<p>However, we also want to talk about using <em><strong>frameworks.</strong></em> Because if 
other people are using software or different code to make their site look great, why not take 
advantage of it and learn how to use it yourself.</p>

<p>In week <strong>one</strong>, we're really going to focus on the theory.</p>

<p>The idea of what is responsive design. What do people mean when they use that term? 
Those of us in technology are pretty guilty of throwing out terms and using them even 
when we don't really know what they mean.</p>

<p>We're going to talk about what makes for good responsive design. If you don't know 
what to aim for, it's really hard to know how to get started.</p>

<p>Finally, we're going to end the week talking about something very concrete and that's 
the role of what we call fluid measurements; these different type of measurements that 
can change as the screen size changes.</p>

<p>In week <strong>two</strong> we're going to tackle media queries.</p>

<p>This is the first time you're really going to get your hands dirty with some code, 
and get things to work.  We're going to talk about what they are. And how do you plan, 
before you even start to code, for the best practice? It doesn't really do you any 
good to sit down and code without having a plan.</p>

<p>In week <strong>two</strong>, we're going to talk about break points, how you can decide 
what different screen sizes are the ones you really want to focus on.</p>

<p>And finally, I am going to do an example where you and I are going to code together to 
make a navigation bar. By the end of week two, you're going to be ready and feel like you 
can really tackle this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08. week 3 - frameworks (10) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Week Three: - Frameworks - Benefits &amp; pitfalls - Bootstrap 3 - Getting 
    Started, grid system, and navigation." />

<p>In week <strong>three</strong>, we're going to shift a little bit and instead of 
writing our own code, we're going to start using different frameworks. In particular, 
we're going to talk about the different benefits and pitfalls of using other people's 
code. Sometimes, it's easier and great to be able to use these different software 
options. But sometimes it comes at the cost of good practice and accessibility. In 
particular we're going to talk about the Bootstrap 3 framework. I've picked this one 
because it's one of the most popular frameworks out there.</p>

<p>Now for those of you who may be familiar with responsive design, you'll know 
that Bootstrap 4 is out. I'm going to focus on those elements of Bootstrap 3 that you're 
going to be able to use over and over again. The simple things such as getting started, 
the grid system, and also, a navigation bar. Because these are the keys to getting your 
site to have that responsive feel.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Week Four: - More bootstrap - Images, tables, advanced navigation - Case studies." />

<p>Finally, in week <strong>four</strong>, we're going to continue with more bootstrap, 
but we're going to talk about things such as images, tables, and some advanced navigation 
techniques. These are things that are cool and kind of fun, but I don't think are core to 
understanding what responsive design is.</p>

<p>So, we leave them at the end to make them something more we can play around with. At the 
end we'll get to some case studies. We're going to talk to people about how they approached 
designing the responsiveness in their real-life sites.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Final Project - Use your coding skills to create a responsive page using 
    multiple methods (framework &amp; media queries)." />

<p>We will do this with the culmination of a final project. When you're done with this 
course, you are going to have one or more pages that you have written yourself. With the 
help of a framework that can respond to different screen sizes.</p>

<p>Who is this class designed for? It's really someone who's new to responsive design. 
Someone who'd like to get started and possibly carry on these ideas once their done with 
the course.</p>

<p>You will need a general knowledge of HTML and CSS in order to get the most out of this 
course. If you don't understand those two concepts, I recommend you go back and get a grasp 
of them and then come back to us in the responsive class. Again, as with any coding class 
at all. This is a class with people with persistence. You're going to run into problems.</p>

<p>This isn't a course where you're going to read something, take a quiz and you're done. 
Instead, we're going to be coding, probably failing a little bit, coding, failing some 
more, then and then hopefully success.</p>

<p>Who am I? Well, if you're new to one of my courses, I have a PHD in computer science. 
I've been teaching for about two decades, sticking mostly with introductory programming, 
web design, and artificial intelligence. What I really love to do is help students debug. 
Help them to get those general basic ideas down so they can go off and really master some 
of the more advanced concepts. And I understand that it's not always about conveying content. 
It's about helping you recognize those places where you might run into trouble. If I can let 
you know early, it might help you get up over some of those humps.</p>

<p>In this course, we're going to have a pretty consistent workload. Every week, you'll 
have multiple modules to read. Some of them will be of traditional lecture format. However, 
there will be other modules which I tend to call, âCode with Meâ. These are lectures where 
I hope you'll sit down and type along with me and make sure you can replicate what I'm doing.</p>

<p>There will be a few weekly readings but there'll always be online articles. I like to 
find things that are very pertinent to what's going on in web design right now.</p>

<p>So how do you succeed in this class?</p>

<p>I will always say that the best way to code is with a friend but that's not always 
possible, so I hope that you'll use the message boards not only to ask your questions but 
to answer the questions of others.</p>

<p>Never spend more than 20 minutes on something that doesn't work. I'm not kidding. I 
want you to just move on. When things are working it's great, you can whip out a whole 
bunch of code. But when it's not it's rarely the case that staring at it is going to make 
it any better.</p>

<p>Make sure that you feel comfortable looking things up on your own. This is the internet; 
you can stick your question into a search engine and you will probably find the answer. 
You'll find three or four wrong answers, but eventually, the answer will be there.</p>

<h2 id="Week1-02">Week 1-02. What is Responsive Design?</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi, everybody, so you're here and I'm here, and we're here to talk about responsive 
design. But one of the first questions should be, what is responsive web design? And what 
it is, is it's designing your web site with the idea that people will be viewing it from 
multiple screen sizes and different resolutions as well. We want to make sure that our 
side is going to, what we call work, under any platform, any browser size or any orientation.
And by orientation, I mean whether you turn your phone up or to the side. And same for the 
tablet.</p>

<p>The most important lesson is that you want to make sure that the user has the power. 
Don't dictate to them what they can and can't do. Let me give you an example. A lot of 
times when you're looking at a site on a smaller screen such as your phone you get a lot 
less content. And while it's true their smaller space it's not that there should be less 
things you can do everything should just be laid out a little bit more intelligently. You 
have to remember that people are doing more and more things on their phone that they've 
never done before.</p>

<p>We often think now about watching videos, but we also have to think about filling out 
applications, or coding. There's going to be a lot of things that we don't even know yet 
that exist, so we want to be as flexible as possible. The most important thing is, never 
assume that the user won't need access to specific functionality. I think we've all been
there when we're looking at a website on a smaller device and we just can't find the thing 
that we're looking for. Or even worse, there's these pictures or buttons or different things 
we can't even move them out of the way with our fingers because the site just won't work for
us.</p>

<p>Here are some of the concepts that we're going to be considering throughout this entire 
course.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 12. concepts to consider, again (14) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image012.webp?raw=true"

  title="Concepts to consider"
  alt="Concepts to consider." />

<p>Three concepts that I want you to keep in the back of your mind. And I'm hoping at the 
end of this course you'll be able to say, yeah, I think I've got that, and the first one 
is called <strong>media queries</strong>, and what media queries do is that they can detect 
the view port size and other information about the device that the browser is on.</p>

<p>The next thing that we're going to want to talk about is this idea of <strong>flexible 
grid-based layout for relative sizing</strong>. And relative means, depending on how large 
the screen is, that's how big your grid is going to be as well. And, finally we want to 
think about <strong>flexible images</strong>.</p>

<p>All these things add up, so that when you go to the page, the user doesn't need to 
waste their time scrolling back and forth or trying to resize things to be able to see 
everything. We want it to happen really automatically.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Media screen and media queries." />

<p>Let's take a look at some examples that have great responsive design. The first place 
I'm going to take you is a website called <em><strong>mediaqueri.es.</strong></em></p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Different media query sites." />

<p>This site has a really nice collection of different sites that it's found that really 
kind of find that key to responsive design. Let's go ahead and take a look at, I'll scroll 
down a few.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%"
  title="Capital Public Radio web sites"
  alt="Capital Public Radio web sites." />


<p>How about this one right here? CapRadio, go anyplace. This site right now, when I'm 
looking at the large screen, you can see that there's a definite look to the layout.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image016.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:45%"
  title="Tablet-sized - Capital Public Radio"
  alt="Tablet-sized - Capital Public Radio." />

<p>As I resize the screen, as if I'm looking perhaps on a tablet, and I reload it you can 
see that things have moved over.</p>

<p>The navigation bar is now over to the left when it wasn't there before.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%"
  title="Smallest - Capital Public Radio"
  alt="Smallest - Capital Public Radio." />

<p>I'm going to go ahead and make it smaller still. I don't even need to refresh. And now 
you might see something that looks much closer.</p>

<p>To that look and feel of something you would see on the phone. The navigation bar has 
completely disappeared, and there's this little pop up and down.</p>

<p>These different sites just don't make everything smaller, let me make it bigger, they 
actually think about the best way to lay out the content, so that you can still find 
everything that's there without having to look too much.</p>

<p>Now, you can use that site to see examples of great responsive design, but what if I 
also wanted to show you an example of kind of bad responsible design.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when you Google that out, or you look for that on your search engine, 
nobody really wants to advertise the fact that they're really bad at web design so I 
found one for you.</p>

<p>It's the Internal Revenue Service. And what we have here is a site that not only looks 
the same, but is laid out the same no matter what type of screen you're looking at.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>It looks okay right here, but when I make the screen much smaller, you can see that it 
didn't really do anything. Now I actually have to physically scroll back and forth to see 
things. The navigation bar hasn't changed. You have the same size pictures.</p>

<p>This is just an example of really bad responsive design.</p>

<p>Let's work together over the next few weeks to make sure that you are avoiding those 
same types of traps, and we're going to get started coding right away.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="Week1-03">Week 1-03. Testing Existing Sites</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi, everybody. One of the things that you're going to want to do is test your site to 
see how it's doing across multiple devices and multiple view ports.</p>

<p>But unless you happen to just be flux with money, you may not have access to all these 
different types of platforms.</p>

<p>What can you do? Well, one option if you're using a desktop or a laptop, that you can 
resize your window and refresh the site.</p>

<p>Here, large view, tablet and mobile view. I can see that I have three different 
break points that all work. That works great if you're on a laptop or some sort of 
desktop, but what if you're on a mobile device?</p>

<p>It isn't simple or even often possible to resize that window, so we need to come 
up with another solution that will help you out.</p>

<p>What you can do is look for online tools to help you check for your responsiveness. 
One that you may want to look at is called ami.responsivedesign.is. <a

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://ibm-web-dev.bauska.org</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to go through and I'm going to show you three different sites and how 
we can use this website to test the responsiveness of these webpages. Here we go.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 22. four views - responsive web design (21) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image022.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Four Views - Responsive Web Design"
  alt="Four Views - Responsive Web Design."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Here's a website that you can go to. Down at the bottom of the screen, you can fill in the 
URL of the site you want to look at.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 23. intro-webdesign.com - responsive web design (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image023.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="intro-webdesign.com - Responsive Web Design"
  alt="intro-webdesign.com - Responsive Web Design."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Just so you know, this is made with an HTML tag that makes it so that you have to put in a 
URL. It's always going to be looking for at least that www. Let's look at that Intro to Web 
Design website again.</p>

<p>There we go. Now if you look up at the top of the screen you can see that my website is now 
displayed on four different platforms. I have the desktop, the laptop, a tablet view and a mobile 
view, and you can see that each one is a little bit different depending upon the platform I'm using.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 24. four views - responsive web design (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image024.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Four Views - Responsive Web Design"
  alt="Four Views - Responsive Web Design."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Let's check out another site.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 25. example four views - responsive web design (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image025.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Example four views - Responsive Web Design"
  alt="Example four views - Responsive Web Design."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>In this case, again we can see that this is a responsive setup. Now, even though the pages may 
look very similar, you can see that on the mobile view that weather map isn't there (2 images back), 
that kind of brightly colored map.</p>

<p>In addition, the laptop and desktop view are very similar. But you can see that in the tablet 
view, we've really broken it down and they use more of a two-column grid system rather than having 
quite as much content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 26. example four views - umich - responsive web design (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image026.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Example four views - umich - Responsive Web Design"
  alt="Example four views - umich - Responsive Web Design."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The next site I'm going to check is one that I've made from my umich site. Going here, paste 
in that URL, and we can take a look. What I've tried to do here is to have a little bit more 
distinct look, so that you can see that I've tried to develop my site for really what the people
might want to be using.</p>

<p>In my larger view I've got my picture, because you know, everybody wants to see me. I've got 
my name and then my contact information. On the laptop view it's very similar. In the tablet, 
I've kind of just reduced the space. That information is still important, but I don't need so 
much space in between them. In my phone viewer, mobile view though, I've gotten rid of the picture 
and I've started to stack the information to make it easier for people to see. I'm able to look at
all four of these views on a single website, and this makes it much easier than trying to go back 
and forth and resize my window.</p>

<p>However, there is the caveat that this site doesn't always work for every different website. It 
may be the case that people aren't using traditional responsive web design. On this site, the pages 
all look the same. But if you were actually viewing them on a browser, they would look different.</p>

<p>The next option you can try is to use tools on your Chrome or Firefox, or whatever browser 
you're using. It's often the case that your browser is going to have special tools that let you 
simulate looking at things from different viewpoints.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 27. chrome's - inspect element (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image027.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Chrome's inspect element"
  alt="Chrome's inspect element."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>With Chrome, you can use inspect element to see the different viewpoints in real-time. Let's 
take a look. I've gone here to my website looking at it in chrome and pretty much enlarge screen 
view. I'm going to drag it out a little bit here. You can see I've got my large screen I've got 
a lot of spacing in it. I'm going to go in and do inspect element by right clicking Click over 
here.</p>

  alt="Mobile Phone view - responsive web design."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>And what I can do now is up in the upper left-hand corner, there's something that looks like 
a small little mobile phone. It says Toggle device mode. I'm going to click on that. And when I 
do, I am now viewing my site as if I'm viewing it on a small mobile phone.</p>

<p>Depending upon your operating system in the browser of the addition that you have, you can go 
up to the device in the upper left-hand corner select mode, or model actually. And say what would 
it look like on an iPhone 6? It is a little bit bigger, what if I look at it on a google nexus 
seven. Same thing. You can pick a number of different options to kind of see what the site would 
look like.</p>

<p>Let's see, do one last one, a laptop. Depending on which type of platform people are using.</p>

<p>Now that you know some quick and easy ways to review the responsiveness of existing sites, it's 
a good idea for you to go out and get that feel for what you think looks really good, or sometimes 
even more importantly, what you think you want to avoid on your site. Go ahead and have some fun 
and mock your friends if their sites aren't responsive. Don't worry, yours will be.</p>

<h2 id="Week1-04">Week 1-04. Benefits of Responsive Design</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody. Today, let's talk about some of the benefits of
responsive design.</p>

<p>First thing we need to realize is that responsive design means different things to different 
people. We're going to talk about three different options that people often use, and why the 
responsive web design that we're going to adopt has its true benefits.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 31. "responsive" options (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image031.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="'Responsive' options; RWD, Adaptive Design and Separate Mobile Site(.m)"
  alt="'Responsive' options; RWD, Adaptive Design and Separate Mobile Site(.m)."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The first option, <em><strong>responsive web design or RWD</strong></em>, is really dealing with 
fluid measurements, flexible grids, and varying CSS rules.</p>

<p>We also have <em><strong>adaptive design</strong></em>, or what's sometimes called <em><strong>
dynamic serving</strong></em>. What happens here is that you can end up returning different 
versions of a page based on the type of device being used.</p>

<p>The third type is the <em><strong>separate mobile site</strong></em>, or <em><strong>.m</strong></em>. 
This is when you create a completely separate page URL for the mobile site.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 32. rwd - responsive web design (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image032.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Absolute Measurements and how their used"
  alt="Absolute Measurements and how their used."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>First, let's talk about <strong>responsive web design</strong>. With
the definition that we're using, the test really is, are you getting
back the same code regardless of the device that you're using?</p>

<p>You know that I'm a big fan of inspect element and viewing the source
code, so my question is, are you going to get the same source code no
matter what platform you're looking at?</p>

<p>Now, as humans we can do that by viewing the source code or other
little tricks. But sometimes when you're thinking about things such as
source engine optimization and getting really high rankings on your
page.</p>

<p>A bot can also tell if you're using responsive web design by looking for certain meta tag 
named viewport. It can be detected automatically and would really, kind of help boost your 
search engine score, is what many people think.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 33. adaptive design (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image033.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Responsive Web Design - Adaptive Design"
  alt="Responsive Web Design - Adaptive Design."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The second type, <strong>adaptive design</strong>, means that the server figures out what kind 
of device you're running on and then returns specific HTML and CSS for that page. You can get 
completely different code depending upon what device you're using.</p>

<p>With responsive web design, it's the same code, just different styling. Here, you're getting 
different content, the important thing you realize is that no matter where you're doing it from, 
you're using the same URL. Now, there's a few issues with this, in that the server might return 
the wrong code if the wrong device type is detected.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 34. benefits of responsive design - separate url (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image034.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Benefits of Responsive Design - Separate URL"
  alt="Benefits of Responsive Design - Separate URL."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>That third option of having a <strong>dedicated mobile site</strong>, or <strong>a .m URL</strong>, 
means that you're going to get a different page completely on a completely different URL when 
you're using this approach. It's incredibly popular and you're going to see it very often.</p>

<p>When you're on a site, check and see if you have .m in front of your normal URL, or 
sometimes even a little bit different URL depending upon your device. It's possible if 
you're going to take this design step to link the fact that pages are related by including 
a link tag and using the relationships canonical and alternate. Which means, you know what?
This is my main page but I do have some alternate URLs out there. Why would you bother 
doing this? Again, it's for search engine optimization. It really helps if the search 
engines can know that this is the same type of information just on different URLs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 35. why rwd? (29) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image035.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Why RWD (Responsive Web Design)?"
  alt="Why RWD (Responsive Web Design)?"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>So why am I stressing responsive web design?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Well, number one, it's a lot easier to share your data if you only have a single URL. You 
    don't want to have to have multiple versions to hand out to people if they want to access 
	your site.</li>
  <li>It's also easier for search engines such as Google to index the page or kind of mark it to 
    know that it seen it before and would like to rank it.</li>
  <li>The number one reason, again, is that fewer files means less maintenance. If you have 
    different HTML code for different platforms, if you change one, that's not maintaining all 
	of them. You have to go in and update every single file.</li>
  <li>And another reason, is that if you have a single place that you're going a single URL, then 
    you're going to have less redirection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Redirection is when you go to a site, and you see that the URL is being changed as the server 
tries to figure out what type of device you're using and what kind of page or URL you should be 
redirected to. Lower load time is always great.</p>

<p>Hopefully you see why responsive design is really important. It may even be obvious to you because 
you're really into this topic. However, if you're ever working a project, you may need to convince 
someone that they need to pay you for that extra time to make sure their site is responsive. And in 
that case, hopefully, you've learned some facts here that can help convince other people how important 
responsive web design really is.</p>

<p>Hi, everybody. Today we're going to talk about fluid measurements. They're really important to 
responsive design. I've seen some really beautifully written and spoken presentations on how 
important it is to have these fluid measurements. And how the artistry of responsive design can 
make things just incredibly good. Just the fact that I use the word good explains that I am not 
that eloquent. I'm going to do my best to show you the technical reasons why you want to use fluid
measurements.</p>

<p>The most important thing is that you really want to understand that
your content, it needs to fit in the size constraints of the viewport.
Don't try to make people use a certain size, it's your job to conform to
them. If you go to a page and you have a lot of vertical scrolling where
you have to go up and down, that's really about content, it's not
something that we're going to concern ourselves with. If you have a lot
of content, people are going to need to scroll. What's bad, what you
really don't want is I hate when people have to do horizontal
scrolling.</p>

<p>When you're on a page and everything doesn't fit in the screen so
you've got to kind of look for it. We want to avoid that whenever
possible.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 38. absolute measurements - how used (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image038.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Absolute Measurements and how their used"
  alt="Absolute Measurements and how their used."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>First, let's talk about absolute measurements. For many people, these
may be the only type of measurements they've used when doing web design.
And they do have their place, so let's talk about how we use them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the pixel, a pixel is basically a dot on your display. 1 pixel used to 
    be equal to 1/96th of an inch, I'm not sure that's even necessarily true at 
	this point. But I can tell you that screen sizes have a lot of pixels and you 
	want to think about that when you're trying to design on pixel size.</li>
  <li>Another option is to use mm, cm, or in. This stands for millimeter, centimeter, 
    or inch. And while it may seem odd to use this kind of measurements when you're 
	doing a webpage, don't forget, it is possible to print out your page. And if 
	you want something to be relative to an 8-and-a-half by 11 pieces of paper, 
	it makes total sense to use these types of measurements.</li>
  <li>Another option you can use is point. And one point, it's equivalent of 1/72 
    of an inch. So again, this is a very concrete measurement.</li>
  <li>Another option you can use is pica. And one pica is the equivalent of 12 
    points. Again, these are all completely valid measurements and they have their 
	place when you're designing your page. But as much as possible, we want to 
	move to relative measurements, where things are sized based either on their 
	parents or their neighbors or on the screen size, different things like that.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 39. relative measurements - 1em=12pt=16px=100% (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image039.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Relative Measurements - 1em=12pt=16px=100% &amp; 1in=2.54cm=25.4mm=72pt=12pc"
  alt="Relative Measurements - 1em=12pt=16px=100% &amp; 1in=2.54cm=25.4mm=72pt=12pc."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Let's start with percent. Percentage values are always relative
to some other value, for example, a length. If you say you want
something to be 75%, it's going to check the container it's in and make
it 75% of that. The measurement came up with its name because it wanted
to be the font size of the letter M element. It seems a little bit odd,
because when you first think about it, it's going to be the same size by
default. If you use one it's going to be that same size. 1.1 will make
it a little bit bigger, 10% bigger. 0.9 will make it smaller than the
default size.</p>

<p>Another thing that you can use is rem. rem is very similar to but it
helps avoid that problem of something getting smaller and smaller and
smaller. Let me show you an example.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 40. more relative measurements - %, em & rem (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image040.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="More Relative Measurements; %, em &amp; rem"
  alt="More Relative Measurements; %, em &amp; rem."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Let's assume we're going to set something up to be 0.5em and it's
going to be inside this element in here. I'm going to make up a size and
I'm going to say, it's this big. Okay, well, the problem is, if I have
another element inside here, the a is going to be only half as big as
that a. And if I have another a in here, it's going to be even smaller.
So, when you use and you have things that are nested inside each other,
the font can actually get smaller and smaller and smaller. And that
might not be how you really want it to go.</p>

<p>If you use rem instead, 0.5rem. Instead, it's always going to be half
the size based on the parent or the root element. This a is going to be
the exact same size and the exact size in here. rem really helped people
out when they were doing these kinds of complex sites where you had a
lot of things embedded inside the other.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 39. again. relative measurements - 1em=12pt=16px=100% (34) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image039.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Relative Measurements - 1em=12pt=16px=100% &amp; 1in=2.54cm=25.4mm=72pt=12pc"
  alt="Relative Measurements - 1em=12pt=16px=100% &amp; 1in=2.54cm=25.4mm=72pt=12pc."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Now, the problem with teaching and learning about relative
measurements, is that it's very abstract. I tried to include a little
thing here to help you make it a little clearer. 1em is basically the
equivalent of 12 points, or 16 pixels, or 100%. If you don't style your
code in any way, you can assume that some of these defaults will fall
in. I've tried to include this little chart here to make it a little bit
more clear. In general, 1em is the equivalent of 12 points, which is the
same as 16 pixels, which is the same 100%. So, you could use any one of
these four. Now, the difference is, if you were to resize your screen
and make it bigger or smaller, only the em and percent would adjust to
the size of the screen. If you used point or pixel, as the screen gets
bigger, the font stays the exact same size. Same if the screen gets
smaller.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 41. relative measurements - vw & vh (35) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image041.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Relative Measurements - vw &amp; vh"
  alt="Relative Measurements - vw &amp; vh."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Two of the newer relative measurements are based on the viewport. vw
stands for viewport width, so if you were to use one vw, you're saying,
I want to use up 1/100th of the width of the viewport. It used to be the
case that you needed to use Javascript to go off, find that width of the
browser, return it, and do some math there. Now, we can just use it with
vw. In the same way, you can use vh for viewport height.</p>

<p>The viewport's height is 1/100<sup>th</sup> of the height of the
viewport. So, if you're on a screen, you'll know exactly how much real
estate you have if you want something to show up exactly in the middle.
This comes in really handy when you're trying to set headers and footers
in specific positions.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image042.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Review Fluid Measurements"
  alt="Review Fluid Measurements."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Now, there are times that you're going to want to hardcode values
with those absolute measurements. But, whenever possible, when you're
coming up with your design, figure out, are you going to need that font,
or that image, or that section to resize depending upon the viewport?
Then, you want to use these fluid and relative measurements.</p>

<p>And I can't stress enough that you're not really going to understand
how they work until you take some time, play with the code and just kind
of see what you can make it do. For that reason, our next module/week (1-06) is
going to be an example of me moving from absolute to relative
measurements.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="Week1-06">Week 1-06. Code With Me: Fluid Measurements</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>One of the things we always talk about is that there's a real
difference between sitting and listening to me talk about something, and
getting in there and coding it yourself, or at least following along
with me while I code it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 43. fluid measurements - 3 column example (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image043.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Fluid Measurements - 3 column example"
  alt="Fluid Measurements - 3 column example."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>So, let's do an example as we go from static or absolute measurements
to something that's more fluid. So, what I have here is a site where
I've used absolute measurements to lay everything out. I have a large
screen, and I have three columns. I'll check out the HTML quickly just
so we can all follow along.</p>

<p>I've got my header, right here. Not much in it other than H1 and H2
element. I have a nice little paragraph over here where I basically say,
I've hard-coded these measurements, what's going to happen when I resize
the screen? And then, the last thing I have is really just a little bit
of craziness. I'm going to pull it down here. It's just three divs, each
of which has an H2 header and a paragraph. They all say the same thing,
it's just some Latin filler, because I don't really care about the
actual content itself. More importantly, let's look over here at the
CSS.</p>

<p>In that main section, the main content of my page I've gone in and
I've hard- coded the value to 980 pixels, the margin 0 auto, just means
hey, make sure you center me, if I'm on a bigger browser. For each
column, because I'm going to have three, I set the width to 300. Now
300, 300, 300 that's only 900 pixels. But, because I leave some margin
in-between each column, it's important we add a little bit of extra
padding there. Everything else is fairly straightforward. I have rules
for the body and the H1 and H2. The only other real measurements I use
are the fact that I set my font size to 13 pixels, and down here for the
H1. I've set my font size to 64 pixels.</p>

<p>All right, let's take a look at this page when I really bring the
content up, so it's something we can see. Here we go. I have it. I have
a fairly large sized screen, in fact, if I maximize it, I can usually
see how big it is. And it looks okay, but as I make the screen smaller,
you're going to see that what happens is the content is hidden. If I
scroll, I can't even scroll up and down. I'm trying. The only way for me
to see more content is to scroll horizontally. And we all know that I
absolutely hate that. In addition, this H1, the fluid measurement, the
font is so big that it kind of overshadows the rest of the content.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to make this big again, and let's think about what we
want to do. One of the keys to responsive design typically is mapping
out what you want your page to look like before you code it, and we're
going to talk about that in week two. But right here, for week one,
let's just wing it a little bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 44. fluid measurements - html & css code (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image044.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Fluid Measurements, codepen HTML &amp; CSS"
  alt="Fluid Measurements, codepen HTML &amp; CSS."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>I'm going to make it so I can see my code. And the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to the first place I hard coded a value,
which is the width of this main part. Saying that I always want it to be
980 pixels, it's just a mistake.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 45. more fluid measurements (38) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image045.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="More Fluid Measurements"
  alt="More Fluid Measurements."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Instead, let's use percent here, and say I want this to take up, let's say somewhere 
between 95 and I'll pick 95% of my page. Already, you could see that things happened 
in there. Not everything we wanted to happen, but a little. I'll resize it again.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 46. smallest fluid measurements (38) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image046.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Smallest Fluid Measurements"
  alt="Smallest Fluid Measurements."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>You can see that my paragraph down here still fits, but the columns
just look at little bit awkward. Particularly, if I'm somewhere in that
awkward range of two columns fit, but not the third. So, while the main
page is responsive, let's work on those columns.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 47. tablet-size - fluid measurements (39) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image047.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Tablet-size Fluid Measurements"
  alt="Tablet-size Fluid Measurements."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Here, I've set them to 300 pixels. Let's change that. Since I have
three columns, again, I can set it to 33, 33, 33, but I'm probably going
to end up with some overlap. So, I'm going to make these 30%, and I'm
going to set the margin left to, we'll use 2%. Now you can already see
this is a huge difference in our page. Whether I make it big, there's
not a lot of wasted white space along the side. And if I make it small,
the columns are still together. This is really good.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 48. fluid measurements - example (39) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image048.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Fluid Measurements - example"
  alt="Fluid Measurements - example."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The last thing I'm going to change, I'm going to go ahead and change
my H1, so I'm using the percent instead. I'll make it 300%. That'll be
big. Okay, I'm going to save this, I'm going to resize, and when you go
in, it will no longer be quite as dramatic over the entire page.</p>

<p>All right, so this is a fairly straightforward example of how we can
take absolute measurements and change them do something that's relative
or responsive to make our page a little bit better. This is just the
first step, but it's an important step and it's something I want you to
play with. So, you can feel like you're beginning to understand
percents, ems, and other things like that. Good luck.</p>

<h2 id="Week2-01">Week 2-01. Media Queries</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody. Today we are going to talk about Media queries.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 49. media queries (42) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image049.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Media Queries"
  alt="Media Queries."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Media queries are going to allow us to adjust the style of out
webpages, depending upon, the properties of the media we're looking at.
We can look at the browser size, width, and other things to decide the
best way to lay out our content. This all started with CSS 2.1. It
allowed us to use different media types.</p>

<p>Inside your HTML you could have multiple links to different style
sheets. But it wouldn't apply all the style sheets just some of them so
here's an example;</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 50. media queries, cont'd (43) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image050.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Media Queries, cont'd"
  alt="Media Queries, cont'd."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Right here the style sheet style is only going to apply when the
content is being displayed on a screen. And for many of you, that's the
only way you know of content being displayed. But for those of us who
are older or just plain old we remember a time when on your computer you
might want to print out directions someplace and so when you printed out
the directions you had the option to turn on or off the pictures and
other things like that.</p>

<p>For us when it came time to actually print out the directions,
the computer would recognize that we're trying to print them out, and
use a completely different style sheet. And this was a big step forward
for us, because it allowed us to, again, have different content and
style depending upon the platform.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 51. css3 (43) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image051.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="CSS3"
  alt="CSS3"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>With CSS3, we have even more capabilities because the style can
depend upon many more features. We can look at the width, the height,
the orientation and even the screen resolution. In addition, we can add
the Boolean operators to increase the power. And what Boolean operators
are just simple âandsâ and âorsâ. So, you might want to say something
along the line of, if itâs a screen and fill in some other properties
there.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 52. the two query components (44) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image052.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="The two query components"
  alt="The two query components."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Let's look at some examples. Every media query has two
components. The first is the media type. We often think of this as
something along the lines of, will this be a screen? Is it a print out?
You might even think about braille or if it's going out to a TV. We can
also use the word all to trigger every possible media type that could
possibly come up.</p>

<p>The second component is the actual query of the media feature and the
trigger size that we want to be looking for. For example, we might be
looking for very specific width, height, orientation or resolution.</p>

<p>Here's an example for you (see above).</p>
<p>The media type that I want to talk about is screen, the CSS will only
apply if we're looking at a screen, but in addition, we also want to
make sure that that screen has a maximum width of four hundred and
eighty (480) pixels. And, a resolution, of one hundred and sixty-three
(163), DPI. So, that's a lot of circling, and that's a lot of new words.
But that's what we're going to talk about, for the next few slides, to
help you really get this idea, of how every query has a media type and
then some sort of trigger size and media feature.</p>
<p>There are three ways to implement media queries.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 53. how to implement media queries (45) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image053.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How to implement media queries"
  alt="How to implement media queries."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The first is to use the import rule. Inside your CSS, you would use
import, you'd include the URL for the style sheet that you want to
import, as well as the different size and conditions on when you want to
import it. In this case if my screen has a minimum width of 600 pixels,
we would want to use smallstyle.css.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 54. how to implement media queries, cont'd (45) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image054.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How to implement media queries, cont'd"
  alt="How to implement media queries, cont'd."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The second approach is to put the media query directly in the style
sheet itself. We would have before any of our rules, we'd have the
@media screen and (min-width:500px). And then inside here, we would put
all of our usual CSS rules for the color, or the font, the size,
different things like that. So, it's all contained inside a single
file.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 55. how to implement media queries, cont'd (46) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image055.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How to implement media queries, cont'd"
  alt="How to implement media queries, cont'd."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The third approach is to include the query in the actual link in the
header of your HTML. So here, instead of just saying link this style
sheet, we've included the trigger and the different rules right inside
our HTML link tag.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 56. how to implement media queries, cont'd (46) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image056.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How to implement media queries, cont'd"
  alt="How to implement media queries, cont'd."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>In general, I'm going to always stick to the second approach; Put
media query directly in the style sheet. This is the one that I
personally use for doing my responsive design, but that doesn't mean you
shouldn't feel free to play with all three of these different
approaches.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 57. review, media screens (47) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image057.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Review, media screens"
  alt="Review, media screens."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Let's review for just a second to make sure that we're on the same
page with how we implement media queries.</p>

<p>In this case I've put my media queries directly into my CSS file. And
what's going to happen is as always CSS start from the top and works its
way down.</p>

<p>We're going to hit that first rule right here that's going to check
and say, hey, I need to see if my display is an actual screen, not a
printout or something like that. If it is, and the screen width is at
least 500 pixels. Then I want to apply these specific rules right here.
But I don't stop. Because this is the CSS, it'll continue to work its
way down and check and say hey am I at least 900 pixels? If I am, I'm
going to apply these rules too. So, it gets tricky at first when you're
first learning how to do responsive design. We're going to do one
together to get your hands wet and have you coding, just make sure that
you start small and we'll go ahead and we'll do something together. Good
luck.</p>

<h2 id="Week2-02">Week 2-02. Code With Me: Fluid Measurements and Media Queries</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hey everybody, welcome back. Let's go look at some code together.</p>

<p><a
href="https://codepen.io/ColleenEMc/pen/pgrYpK/">Code With Me-CodePen</a></p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 58. fluid measurements and media queries (48) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image058.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Fluid Measurements and media queries"
  alt="Fluid Measurements and media queries."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>What we're looking at here is an example from when we first learned
about fluid measurements. We went in and we switched our absolute
measurements of pixels and started using percents. And it works out
really well, unless you take it and you look at a small screen. Right
now, the three columns are fine.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 59. small fluid media queries (48) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image059.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Smaller view of media queries"
  alt="Smaller view of media queries."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>But when we get smaller, right here, it really doesn't make sense to
try to shove three columns worth of content into such a small screen.
This is where the idea of mobile first really comes in. What I think
would be a much better look is to have each column stacked on top of
each other and only go to three columns when you're on a large screen.
So, let's take a look at how we can make that change together.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 60. html and css - fluid measurements (49) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image060.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="HTML and CSS for fluid measurements"
  alt="HTML and CSS for fluid measurements."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The first thing that we need to look at is what these columns are.
And what we have is we have dibs each of type class equals column. The
nice thing about divs is that by default, they're block. If we don't do
anything at all they're going to be stacked just the way we want them to
be. So, let's find our code. Right here. You can see that I went in and
I said I only want them to be 30% and in line block. I floated them and
all that great stuff there. The truth is, when we think mobile first, we
shouldn't be changing anything at all in the column.</p>

<p>I'm going to take this code and I'm going to delete it. All
right, I've done it, their block, and on the large screen, it looks
really silly. But on the smaller screen we have success I was looking
for. Now the question is, how do we go from a single column to three
columns as we get bigger? And the answer is to use media queries.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to scroll down to the bottom of my CSS. And I need to
add some code. How do we make a media query? Don't forget, it's all
about putting in that type and that break point.</p>

<h4>@media screen and min-width</h4>

<details open>
  <summary>CSS:</summary>
  
<pre>@media screen and (min-width:778px)
{
.column {
  width:30%;
  display: inline-block;
  float: left;
  margin-left: 2%;
  }
}</pre>

</details>

<p>I'm going to put in at media screen. And, min-width, let's go
ahead and pick a number. I'm going to say 778. All right, make this a
little bigger so you can see it. What I'm saying is, hey browser, if you
are this size or bigger, I want you to run some special code. And what
code is it? It's that code that says, never mind, I don't want to be a
single column, I want to be three columns. So, I'm going to put that
back in there. Save it. And boom, it happened already.</p>

<p>It goes in, the browser figures out your size, and then goes in and
makes any changes. This is hopefully pretty straight forward to you,
although you might want to look at the code for a little bit, change the
numbers. I'm going to change this to 1,200, right away it goes back. You
can play with these break points, these are the break points that we
talked about earlier, to find that perfect look for your page. As we
make more and more complicated media queries, I really want you to go
back and make sure you understand these simple ones first. Good
luck.</p>

<h2 id="Week2-03">Week 2-03. Wire Frames</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi. Today, we're going to talk about wireframes and as we talk about
them, I have to admit the way in which I teach web design doesn't really
mimic the way you should really do it in the real world, in that I tend
to talk about the coding aspects first. The things you can do to create
something real right away. But this lecture should have really come
earlier in the course, because your layout is one of the first things
you should think about.</p>

<p>If you're going off to be a web designer, you're going to need to
realize that coding comes after your design. And wireframes provide a
visual representation of your layout. This is what you're going to use
when you decide it's time to start coding.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 61. wireframe showcase: interealty exchange (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image061.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Wireframe showchase: Interealty Exchange"
  alt="Wireframe showchase: Interealty Exchange."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>What do I mean by a wireframe? Let me show you a few examples. Right
here, I'm at a site called wireframeshowcase.com.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 62. wireframe showcase: wilshire homes (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image062.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Wireframe showchase: Wilshire Homes"
  alt="Wireframe showchase: Wilshire Homes."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>And If you scroll through the page, kind of up and down, you can see that you see a little
bit of a few different pages. Real pages but also you see some graphical
sketches underneath them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 63. wireframe showcase: interealty exchange, #2 (53) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image063.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Wireframe showchase: Interealty Exchange, #2"
  alt="Wireframe showchase: Interealty Exchange, #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Let's go back up to the first one. Up here I'm going to go ahead and
go in and kind of show you what it means when we click on the view
details. When I hover over the page you can see what the site's going to
look like when it's set out on the screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 64. wireframe showcase: interealty exchange, #3 (53) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image064.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Wireframe showchase: Interealty Exchange, #3"
  alt="Wireframe showchase: Interealty Exchange, #3."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>But when I've come off just a little bit, you can see that all those visual 
representations are actually based on very plain, very unstyled little documents. 
That's what we're going to talk about today.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 65. decide on major content (54) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image065.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Decide on major content"
  alt="Decide on major content."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>So, before you can start drawing, you need to decide what you need to have on 
your page. This includes both text and graphics. If it really needs to be there, 
you need to know at the beginning. What is going to be the best layout for this 
material? Once you know what you need to have, you can start thinking about different 
things such as, on a mobile view, we might want a different type of navigation 
bar. We want all the same material just a different layout.</p>

<p>When we're on a laptop view you might decide you want to add a little bit of 
extras but first you need to figure out how you're going to lay out those necessities.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 66. mobile view (54) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image066.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Mobile view"
  alt="Mobile view."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Again, as always, I'm going to remind you that the mobile view is the
most important view in web design. If you don't think about the mobile
view first, it's very simple for you to start coming up with a clear
idea, and then as you shrink it down, throwing things out. No. At the
beginning you decided this was important. So, if it is important, make
sure you design it for that mobile view.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 67. mobile view, #2 (55) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image067.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Mobile view, #2"
  alt="Mobile view, #2."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Letâs give an example. You might know that you want to have header, a section, 
inside that section you're going to have an article and maybe an aside, and you're 
also going to have a footer. Because you're on a mobile view, things tend to go 
right from the top down to the bottom and very few things side to side. We just 
don't have the space.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 68. larger view (55) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image068.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Larger view"
  alt="Larger view."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Once you've decided on that mobile view and you've sketched it out, you can 
go on to what you might want it to look like on the larger view. In this case 
the header and the footer are the same but we have more flexibility with where 
we want to put that other content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 69. functionality (56) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image069.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Functionality"
  alt="Functionality"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>You also want to think about functionality when you're doing your
wireframes. The design should be about more than just the layout. You
can use these wireframes to test out the interaction that your page
might go through as well. Navigation, form inputs, different things like
that. If you don't think about that at the beginning, you run into a lot
more problems when it's time to code.</p>

<p>Did you want it to be a drop-down menu, a hover actions, we need to
think about this functionality from the beginning.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 70. sketches vs wireframes (56) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image070.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Sketches vs. Wireframes"
  alt="Sketches vs. Wireframes."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Many people refer to sketches and wireframes and kind of wonder what the difference 
is. I always recommend starting with a sketch. With this idea with a sketch, is 
that you're just kind of drawing with your hand and it's very free-form. One of 
the reasons to do this is that I know when someone hands me a very nicely typed 
paper, or some nice computer printout, I'm more hesitant to give back feedback. 
Well, if you give me a nice kind of hand drawn piece of paper, you can really dive 
into it and say, no, what if you do this. You don't mind marking up their stuff 
as much.</p>

<p>When you do a sketch, when you do it by hand, you get less, I would say, attached 
to it. You're more likely to be willing to make changes because you didn't spend 
five hours getting the perfect border or putting things in just the right spot.</p>

<p>So, let's take a look at another place where I'm not going to cover myself, 
but there are places where you can figure out these kind of best design practices 
as you start sketching out your page and eventually moving on.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 71. 10 best practices - wireframes (57) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image071.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="10 Best Practices to Free Your Wireframes"
  alt="10 Best Practices to Free Your Wireframes."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One of the reasons I like this site is well because I agree with many of the 
things they're talking about and they agree with me. But as you look around, you're 
going to see that most articles talk about best practices. These aren't rules, 
these are just ideas and suggestions for you to think about. So, for instance, 
one suggestion is don't use color.</p>

<p>Again, this goes back to the idea that wireframes and sketches are about content. 
It's about figuring out how you want to lay it out and use it. Once you start throwing 
in color, things start taking on more meaning when maybe they weren't supposed to. 
You want to be very consistent when you're doing your side. Don't worry about other 
things such as padding and spacing and certain little elements that might be different 
on a single page. Think about your over line sketch. The next one is always a problem 
for people because when you're designing you actually tend to get really into it. 
It's important that you use actual content in your page because when you do this 
it really helps you visually look at the page and realize, this part's getting 
lost or this section is really too big. Maybe I should be breaking it up in to 
more sections.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 72. review (58) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image072.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Review"
  alt="Review"
  style="width:35%" />

<ul>
  <li>This last one I'm going to talk about and then you can kind of do the page 
    alone if you like, is this idea that you never wire a loan. This, I hope, is 
    an underline concept you're getting from all of the courses that you're taking 
    with me. It's never good to code a loan, design a loan, it should really be 
    a give and take as much as possible. As we're together starting off this class, 
    or even as you're ending it up, it can be really difficult to come up with sketches, 
    because we tend to make really small pages because we're just getting started. 
    Plus, we don't have official clients who are giving us feedback. We really only
    have maybe your friends and family and if you get on the message board and show 
    people your sketches. So don't be discouraged or feel like you're doing something 
    wrong if you have a hard time coming up with sketches at the beginning.</li>
  <li>The other challenge I find that when you're doing something like this is you 
    really want to keep things simple and changeable. Like I said, it's really impressive 
    to give somebody a print out with everything you've placed. But it's not always 
    the best way to get feedback. Also, it sometimes feels like, I can do so much 
    more! Simple design is always going to be the best design.</li>
  <li>The other thing I'd really like to just mention to you is that, if the design 
    is where you're at, this is the part you've really taken this course for, it's 
    still important to understand the basics of coding. That's going to help you 
    understand how you can convey your ideas to the programmers and let them make 
    something really great out of your design.</li>

<h2 id="Week2-04">Week 2-04. Breakpoints</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody. Every once in a while, I like to step back and think
about some of the terms I use in this class and make sure I've actually
defined them for you so we're all in agreement or understand what the
general meaning is.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 73. breakpoints (59) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image073.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Breakpoints"
  alt="Breakpoints"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>One of those terms is breakpoint. People hear it talk about it all the time 
when they're talking about responsive design, but what are they?</p>

<p>Breakpoints are sizes or positions that define a change in your site layout 
or content. So, you might say, I'm going to set a breakpoint at 500 pixels, 800 
pixels and 1,000 pixels. And depending on those sizes you're expecting to see some 
sort of change.</p>

<p>We use these breakpoints to provide the best possible experience for users based 
on the device information we have. Now, there's more to it than just breakpoints.</p>

<p>You might also want to talk about resolution, whether using print, but breakpoints 
are really a key element that you want to understand. The other phrase I use quite 
a bit in conjunctions with breakpoints is this idea that they trigger something, 
breakpoints trigger changes. And to be honest, it may not be the best phrase to 
use. That's because most people don't actually resize their window when they're 
on it. You open up your screen and there it is.</p>

<p>As developers I encourage you to open up your browser, make it big, make it 
small, kind of resize it all the time. But most people aren't going to do that 
when they're viewing your page.</p>

  alt="Determining the Breakpoints."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>So, when we talk about triggering these changes, we often mean triggering rules 
in your style sheet instead. That's why I'm going to use breakpoints to refer to 
which rules I apply in different situations. So how do you determine what those 
breakpoints should be? While I'm teaching, I'm kind of notorious for just randomly 
picking numbers and throwing them out there, because I'm just trying to do things 
on the fly.</p>

<p>In the real world, people tend to set their breakpoints based on one of two 
things. The first is devices. They'll think ahead and think of all the different 
devices out there, and try to figure out which breakpoints correspond to the different 
machines. Other people feel strongly that you shouldn't think at all about the 
different devices that are out there. Because they change all the time. There's 
always a new phone, a new tablet, and you can't keep up with that. Instead, you
should base your breakpoints based on the content of your page. You figure out 
what it is you want there and decide when will it really look good next to each 
other versus not. Let's talk about using devices as a breakpoint.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 76. screen sizes (61) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image076.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Screen sizes"
  alt="Screen sizes."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>What I have here is just a quick little shot of some of the most common devices 
and their screen sizes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>With the iPhone 4, you'd want to think about breakpoints at 320px and maybe 
    480.</li>
  <li>The iPhone 5, when that came along, all of a sudden, you'd need to think 
    about a different max width because it's up to 568px.</li>
  <li>iPhone 6 got a little bit bigger still, and then the</li>
  <li>iPhone 6+, well, let's just agree it's ridiculous. The new iPhone is supposedly 
    going to be even smaller so you'd need to think about new screen sizes for that.</li>
  <li>We also have the Galaxy S3 and S4, they have very similar breakpoints.</li>
  <li>And then, the S5, again, the same thing, just a little bit bigger on the 
    smaller screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this is how most people come up with their breakpoints. They'll look 
at the screen sizes, find some that are similar or find the lowest possible number 
for the smallest screens and maybe the biggest possible number for the larger screens 
and just build around those.</p>

<p>In most cases, your content's going to fill in just fine. And it would be impossible 
for you to go in and try to have a different view for each one of these sizes. 
And of course, when we talk about breakpoints, we want to talk about mobile first.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 77. mobile first (62) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image077.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Mobile First"
  alt="Mobile First."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>In a lot of paradigms, you're never going to see a breakpoint of 320
pixels or even 360 pixels. You're not going to see that because they're
already designing as if the default style sheet covers the smallest
possible screen. The good thing about this or the great thing about this
means that your page is going to work successfully and show all of your
content even on much bigger screens, because you don't have any
breakpoints that you may or may not miss. So that's a really great thing
about designing mobile first. That also means though, that if you're
going to be using code that isn't yours, maybe you have someone else's
style sheet.</p>

<p>If you see them using max-width instead of min-width in their rules,
that means they did not design for mobile first and you might need to
move things around. But as I mentioned at the beginning of this lecture,
today, I really just wanted to talk about these key words.
<em><strong>Breakpoints, triggering, mobile first</strong></em>. You
won't really get a good feel for them until you've had the time to write
some code yourself. So don't worry if youâre not familiar with them at
first. But make sure youâre constantly thinking back, hey, what does a
breakpoint mean again, is this an example of triggering, and I really
hope you'll really understand mobile first by the time that we're done
with this course.</p>

<h2 id="Week2-05">Week 2-05. Media Queries Part Two</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p><a
href="https://codepen.io/ColleenEMc/pen/zrjKqP/">Media Queries CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>Today's lecture is about media queries. And yes, I've already given
you a lecture on media queries but I really want to give you another
one. Because media queries are something that it's much easier watching
me do it than doing it yourself. So today, three simple steps that I
want you to try at your best to follow and then, we'll look at an
example.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 78. easier watched than done (63) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image078.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Easier Watched than Done"
  alt="Easier Watched than Done."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The key to understanding media queries is to actually use them in
responsive design. This lecture is going to describe that process in
three steps, but you won't necessarily need to use all of them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 79. step 1: grab information (63) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image079.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Step 1: Grab Information"
  alt="Step 1: Grab Information."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>So, the best I can do is give you guidelines. Step one, this is
something that will cause your page to work or not work many times on
mobile phones. It's a simple bit of code that you want to include in the
head of your HTML. What we have here is a meta tag. And what it's going
to do is it's going to convey this information to your browser. We're
going to be using different view ports. And it wants a browser to let
your style sheets know, hey, how big you are? You're always going to
leave the code exactly like this. You're simply saying, I want to know
the view port, I want to know the content width, this initial-scale
equals one that basely just kind of set what your size is going to be.
Now, if you ever been to a site where things are really small and you
want to make it bigger so you can read it a little better. And it just
won't let you do that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 80. step 1: grab info, #2 (64) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image080.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Step 1: Grab Info, part #2"
  alt="Step 1: Grab Info, part #2."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>That is because somebody has put this very horrible, horrible piece
of code into their HTML. Instead of saying just initial-scale equals
one, it also has maximum-scale equals one. I mention this not because I
want you to put it into your site, but because it's pretty common
practice when you're first coding to use other people's code. So if you
see this happening, you want to take it out. It's just a really bad
experience for many people trying to use your page if they can't make
things bigger or smaller. So that's step one. It's not only going to
help your browser know that you're going to be doing responsive design.
It may actually help your search engine optimization as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 81. step 2: fluid layout (64) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image081.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Step 2: Fluid Layout"
  alt="Step 2: Fluid Layout."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>In step two, I really want to encourage you to use fluid layouts.
It's very often the case that when people use breakpoints, they then use
absolute measurements. The reason for that is if you think about it,
they know pretty much how big the screen's going to be. They know that's
going to be somewhere between here, That size and that size. Based on
the fact that they know how many pixels wide the screen is going to be,
they can hard code the width of some of their elements. You're going to
see this in Bootstrap all the time. But, just because somebody else does
it, doesn't mean the you should.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 82. step 2: fluid layout, #2 (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image082.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Step 2: Fluid Layout, #2"
  alt="Step 2: Fluid Layout, #2."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>I want you to use those other things such as percentages, and ems.
These are really great fluid measurements. Percentages you tend to use
more on element such as images and dibs. Ems are a measurement of
typography. So 1em is the width of one letter M. If you're not sure, you
don't remember that, don't forget to go back and look at some of the
fluid measurement modules. I also hear that Bootstrap 4, one of the
platforms we're going to use is going switch over to ems and rems,
too.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 83. step 2: fluid layout, #3 (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image083.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Step 2: Fluid Layout, #3"
  alt="Step 2: Fluid Layout, #3."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The last thing I just like to remind people is that when you use
these fluid measurements for things like padding and margin, the
percents are affected by the width not the height of your page. What
does that mean? It means if you're page is this big, let's switch to the
pen there. The padding is affected by how wide it is. So, 50% padding
would pretty much give you something like this. If you make the page
wider then you would get more padding. However, if you make the page the
same but you make it taller, the height doesn't affect it at all. So, it
doesn't seem like a big deal until you're stuck trying to code it. Just
remember paddings and margins, when you use percent, they're affected by
the width of the page, not the height.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 84. step 3: media queries (66) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image084.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Step 3: Media Queries"
  alt="Step 3: Media Queries."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>That third step is really the biggest step. And that is including
those media queries. The fluid layout is triggered by these certain
break points that you want to use. Design for that smaller screen and
work bigger. Some sites like to strip out information, or even just set
it to display none when the site is small, because they think, that's
not really important information. Well, that's kind of you deciding for
other people what they might want to see. It drives me crazy when I go
to a site and I have to click on a link to go to large size view. Or
when it just won't let me access information at all. You don't want to
penalize your mobile users. You also need to realize that just because
you set something to hidden or display none, the content might still be
downloaded. And this can affect performance. They're still downloading
big things like pictures. And you're eating up their data. So think
small screen and grow bigger.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 85. ordering your rules (66) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image085.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Ordering Your Rules"
  alt="Ordering Your Rules."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>When you put in these media queries, it's common to have a few
different sets of rules. You might have your large screen, and then a
medium screen.</p>

<p>And then, here's my default mobile view. I want you to look at this
and if you need to, I want you to pause the video and I want you to see
if you can figure out why this is bad code. All right. Did you see it?
Let's see. I added one additional rule here. I just added in some size.
But if you notice, as I resize this window, nothing happens. Nothing is
getting triggered. Why is that? Well, itâs because I haven't ordered
things correctly. Style sheets always start from the top and work their
way down. All right, so the first thing itâs going to do is itâs going
to check and say, do I have a minimum width of 1,024 pixels? If you do,
great. It's going to apply the background blue and the width of 25%.</p>

<p>But here's the problem. If you have a minimum width of 1,024 pixels
right there, that means you also have a minimum width of 780. If it's
going to happen when it's big, it's going to happen when it's smaller.
So, this rule overwrites the one above it. And then down here, this one,
it's not even inside a rule. You're basically saying always apply this
styling.</p>

<p>Our rules are syntactically correct. This is a valid piece of
code. It's the logic that we need to fix. Let's start by doing this. I'm
going to take that default rule, and I'm going to move it up to the top.
And as soon as I do that, let's see what happens. Well, one, you can see
that it's now yellow, so we know that it's at least 780 pixels. But when
I look at it, you can usually see it's actually 1,800 pixels, so I would
expect it to be blue. But it is working on the small view, so that's
good. So, we have two out of the three views. Well, that problem still
exists that the order isn't correct. When you're triggering on minimum
width, you want to make sure you're always testing for your smallest
sizes first. Save this and now we have, I'm hoping it'll go from green
to yellow, to blue. As you can see, I still added fluid measurements
because as the size of the screen grows so does my H1, because I set it
to 25%. These are the type of things that it's really simple to nod
along, say yep, yep, I got it. And it isn't until you write your own
code that you're going to accidentally make these mistakes and not know
what's going on.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 86. concept check (67) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image086.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Concept Check"
  alt="Concept Check."
  style="width:35%" />
  
<p>My advice to you is to always add one media query at a time, and make
it something simple. Put in that media query, add a rule, test it, build
from there. Add a new media query, add a rule, test it. It's the best
way to make sure that your code's going to be clean. And with that, I'm
pretty much going to leave you with a concept check here.</p>
<p>The question I'm going to ask is, should your media queries be at the
top or the bottom of that page? Where you have your little at media. The
example I just showed you is that, well, they should go closer to the
bottom. Have all your default styling first, and then trigger media
questions.</p>
<p>But in all honesty, itâs a bit of a trick question.</p>
<p>If you're assuming min-width, if you're doing mobile first, put the
rules on the bottom. If you're using somebody else's code and they
didn't use that mobile first paradigm, and they're searching for max
width, then itâs completely the opposite you want to put those rules at
the top. It can be tricky, and that's why I encourage you, to get into
good habits at the beginning, and continue them as you get better and
better at coding responsive design.</p>

<h2 id="Week2-06">Week 2-06. Code with Me: Responsive Navigation</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody, today, with this lecture I'm hoping you'll sit with me and write up some code 
where we use media queries to produce responsive navigation. In particular we want to make one 
page where the navigation bar is at the top on a small screen and off to the side on larger 
screens.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 87. html with no styling in nav bar (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image087.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="HTML with no styling in nav bar"
  alt="HTML with no styling in nav bar."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>So, let's look at some code. What I have here is some HTML that doesn't have any styling on 
the navigation bar. What you have is a nice horizontal line of links right up here at the top of 
your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 88. html styling nav bar (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="HTML styling the nav bar"
  alt="HTML styling the nav bar."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>What I would like to do is design my page, so that on small screens, the navigation bar is still 
on the top. But instead, when I'm on larger screens, we have more room to play with. I want to put 
that navigation bar, off to the side. Let me draw you a little picture here. Small screen, I want 
the bar to be along the top here and then you'd have all the content. But on a larger screen, it 
can be this big, then I want my navigation bar to be along the side and we can put all the content 
right off to the right.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 89. html and css: responsive navigation (70) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image089.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="HTML and CSS: Responsive Navigation"
  alt="HTML and CSS: Responsive Navigation."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Let's take a look at how we're going to do that. Because we want to do mobile first, that means 
by default we already have it set up where the navigation bar is where we want it, but let's go 
ahead and add a little bit of styling. I'm going to cheat and copy and paste this in here for just 
a second.</p>

<p>What I've done, is I've just added a little bit of styling to not only the navigation, but now, 
we also have it so that the links themselves are also styled. I've put in some border radius, 
to make them nice and circular. I've added the margin and the padding. And, just in case you look 
at it, and kind of wonder what's going on, I've done a little trick that I do, in order to center 
text inside these little.</p>

<p>I've gone ahead and set the line height to 45 pixels. What this does is it gives this kind of 
little extra padding on the top and the bottom to help fill up the size. You should play with this, 
and see if you like it. Well even though we have it looking great, the way we want it on a 
small screen, let's see what happens when we make the screen larger. Well at the moment, nothing 
happens when we make the screen larger. And that makes sense because we didn't put in any media 
queries. We do have a slight bit of responsive design simply because I've used fluid measurements.</p>
 
<p>
That margin and that padding, it's going to adjust as I resize the screen. But I don't just want 
things to adjust. I want a completely new layout, so let's get started. The first thing that I'm
going to do is add in my media query. @media all and (min-width) I'm just going to go ahead and set 
this to 900 pixels. It's a nice big size, and it'll give us a really clear break point as to where 
we want things to change. So, I've done that, and now I can start adding new rules.</p>

<p>Some people love to jump right in, and start doing a whole bunch of coding. It would make sense 
that sense we're doing navigation bars that we would want to start adjusting the different 
navigation. I'm not going to do that thought. What I always recommend is somebody write a very
simple, clear rule. The reason is, it's really easy for you to figure out whether or not your 
rules are triggering.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="Step by step - change background color"
  alt="Step by step - change background color."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Let's go ahead and just change the entire color of the body of this page. Put in body, curly 
bracket, background, color, I'll just make it blue. All right it worked. If for some reason you 
typed that in and it didn't change anything on your screen, You want to stop. Don't start doing 
new complicated things if you can't even get this little one to get going. See if I can get away 
with grey. There we go.</p>

  title="Background color change from blue to gray"
  alt="Background color change from blue to gray."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>You can still see everything. If you run into problems, the parts you want to check are go in 
did you remember to have minimum width? If you do maximum width, then as you make it larger, it 
might trigger on and off. Make sure you've added the pixels at the end so it knows what it's 
looking for. Make sure you have two sets of curly brackets. Notice I have one set that starts my 
media query. And then a second one that goes with the body selector.</p>

  alt="Navigation bar to the side."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>If that's going, let's go ahead and move on to how we would change that navigation bar to be 
off to the side instead of on the top. One of the first steps we're going to want to take is 
changing the styling for the nav tag. I have it for you, right here. The most important thing 
is that I want this to be off to the side, now. By default, nav is block, so it takes up the 
entire width. Now, I only want it to take up a small bit along the side. In fact, I said that I 
want it to take up 20%. As the screen gets larger, it will still take up 20% of the screen.
I also have a min-width of 125 pixels because I just don't want it to get too small. This now 
has placed the nav bar off to the side, but it still doesn't look quite right. What I need, is I 
need to style those individual links as well. That they go right underneath each other. Let's 
do that next code. How do I do that?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Style navigation bar individual links; 20% width max, 125px min."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>How do I get the links to go underneath each other? Well, that's not too hard if you remember 
some of the more advanced CSS you've learned earlier. The most important thing is that I want to 
make it display block, right here. Once you do that, well, now they have to go underneath each 
other. I played a little bit with the text decoration and the padding, but other than that, 
everything is just a little bit of extra styling.</p>

<p>The important thing for the layout was to make everything display block. Let's take a look at 
what we have for a second. We have our navigation bar and it's off to the side as we were hoping. 
And it only takes up some of the space. But we really wanted the content to be next to it. We 
wanted it to be over here to the side. And instead, it ended up underneath.</p>

<p>I'm just going to tell you. The problem isn't with our navigation, it's actually with the 
section that comes underneath it. I'm going to go down here. If you think about it, every section 
by default is block, so it's a simple enough trick to get these things to be next to each other. 
I'm going to add the code right now.</p>

<p>In order to get this to work I've added a little bit more code. I went in and I said, you 
know what, this section can't be block, it needs to be inline block. And since I made the 
navigation bar about 20% I went ahead and made this 70% because I'm not feeling like I want to 
do the math of the margins and the padding right now. I also set the height to 100 viewport 
height to take up the whole screen. I did have to go back and change one thing up in my nav as 
well.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>I had to add a float left, right down here if you look. And this is what lets 
these two things be next to each other off to the side. So let's take a look at 
what we've got.</p>

<p>On the big screen, we've got the vertical navigation bar. On the small screen, 
we jump back to the horizontal navigation bar. Neither one of these things had a 
lot of tricky CSS to it. But the important part was remembering to put in that media 
query, that's what triggers everything.</p>

<p>If you didn't code along with me right now, I hope you'll stop, write some code 
on your own and see if you can't get things to move around. Try to do it in such a 
way that you can see it really making sense. Where you know that on small screen 
phones they really do their navigation differently than if you're on a laptop. Good 
luck, and make sure to post questions if you run into trouble.</p>

<h2 id="Week3-01">Week 3-01. Frameworks</h2>

  style="width:35%" />

<p>Hi, everybody. Frameworks is one of those words or terms that people really 
love to throw out there. The term framework can really mean different things depending 
upon who you ask and what they do.</p>

<p>The general agreement though, is that frameworks are meant to make your job 
easier by providing code and structure. Once you learn how to use a framework, 
you're able to develop your sites quickly and easily without changing too much 
code. So again, when we talk about framework, we want to think about what does 
framework mean here in this class.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 97. what does framework mean here? (78) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image097.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="What Does Framework Mean Here?"
  alt="What Does Framework Mean Here?"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>For front-end developers, frameworks provide tools for CSS, JavaScript, and 
jQuery. They're these little bits of code that you can use to get an instant look 
that you're looking for. And sometimes an instant behavior that you're looking 
for as well with the JavaScript and the jQuery.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="What does framework mean here, part 2"
  alt="What does framework mean here, part 2."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>If you're a back-end developer, this is something completely different as far 
as frameworks go. Now you're looking at code that's going to help you do routing, 
resources, templates and security. This is something completely different. When 
we're done talking about frameworks, you might find that you don't necessarily 
understand some of the terms that other people are using. Just make sure that you 
realize that we're doing front-end development, not back-end development. In saying 
that, I think it's important that you know at least a handful of frameworks that 
people are using today.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:35%" />

<ul>
  <li>The first one that I'm going to mention, and the one that we're going to study 
    in this course is Bootstrap. Bootstrap was developed in 2011. And, basically, the 
    reason it's so popular is because it was one of the first and, once you get that 
    niche, people really tend to use it over and over again.</li>
  <li>Another framework that you may have heard of is called Foundation by ZURB. 
    It again developed in 2011 and is great, it has a lot of different code you can 
    use, but because it's not as popular as Bootstrap people just don't tend to use 
    it nearly as much right now.</li>
  <li>Semantic UI is another framework that's a little bit more recent. If you've 
    been taking my classes, you know that I love the word semantic. Semantics has 
    a meaning. So, what they're doing with their framework is trying to use as 
    much natural language, English-like terms as possible when you make your website.</li>
  <li>The next one is Pure by Yahoo!</li>
  <li>And, the last one I was going to mention was the Ulkit by YOOtheme.</li>
</ul>

<p>Templates are really interesting. Some people build their sites
directly from the template. They grab some HTML code, they change it
around, and they're done. They only provide the content and they still
get a great looking site.</p>

<p>Other people develop their code on their own, but they'll go in and
they'll use some frameworks to add little functionality that they don't
want to code themselves, or they're unable to code themselves.</p>

<p>Now there are things such as pure coders, particularly computer
scientists and the really, you know, us really geeky types, who
sometimes think, nope, I'm going to write everything from scratch. I'm
not going to use other people's code. I disagree with that. I think that
if you want to learn web design, it's important that you get to know at
least one popular framework. That way, you'll be able to communicate
with others who are doing web design, and if need be, jump in
quickly.</p>

<p>As we start to learn more about Bootstrap, I want you to understand
that it's a tool, and it's supposed to be making your life easier. If it
isn't, that's okay, you can go back to coding on your own, but you still
want to know a little bit about it.</p>

<h2>Most popular frontend frameworks 2023;</h2>

<h3>Hydration</h3>

<p>One key challenge of popular frameworks is how to make them work
efficiently in the browser. When a user loads a web page, the browser
needs to download all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then parse and
render the page. If you have a lot of JavaScript code that needs to be
executed before the page is fully interactive, the user might have to
wait a long time before they can use the application.</p>

<p>This is where hydration comes in. Hydration is the process of taking
the static HTML that was generated by the server and <a
href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3661810/reactive-javascript-the-evolution-of-front-end-architecture.html" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attaching JavaScript functionality to 
it on the client side</a>. This allows the user to interact with the page right 
away, while the JavaScript code is still loading and running.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 101. hydration in web development (81) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

<p>Image credit: <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/xqd4i8/what_is_hydration/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Reddit</a></p>

<p>So, let's say you have a React application. When a user first loads
the page, the server generates some HTML that includes the basic
structure of the application. Then, when the browser loads the page, the
React framework "hydrates" the HTML by attaching the appropriate
JavaScript code to each HTML element, so that they can respond to user
events and update the UI as needed.</p>

<p>The benefit of hydration is that it allows you to create complex,
interactive web applications that run smoothly and efficiently in the
browser. By separating the initial HTML rendering from the JavaScript
functionality, you can optimize all aspects of the page/app loading
speed.</p>

<h2>Single Page Applications (SPAs)</h2>

<p>Over the past decade, SPAs have become increasingly popular due to their ability 
to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 102. single page applications (82) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image102.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Single Page Applications"
  alt="Single Page Applications."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>In fact, many of the most successful modern web applications, such as Gmail, 
Google Maps, and Facebook, are built using SPAs. This is because SPAs enable a 
seamless and smooth user experience by eliminating the need for page reloads and 
minimizing the amount of data sent to the server.</p>

<p>Another reason why SPAs are popular is that they allow for a cleaner separation 
between the front-end and back-end of an application.</p>

<p>With SPAs, the front-end is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user 
interactions, while the back-end is responsible for providing data and API endpoints. 
This separation of concerns makes it easier to develop and maintain large-scale 
applications.</p>

<h2>JAMStack</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 103. jamstack (82) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image103.webp?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  title="JAMStack"
  alt="JAMStack"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>JAMstack is a unique concept for building static web pages. Rather than implementing 
a back-end solution for content generation, an API is used instead. The end result 
is that the website is both faster, but also simpler to manage from the developers' 
perspective.</p>
<p>The definition for JAMstack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>J</strong> for JavaScript - the language used to write front-end 
    functions.</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong> for API - requesting content (data) from third-party services.</li>
  <li><strong>M</strong> for Markup - structuring the content on the web page.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for stack, it's the combination of tools you're using. JAMstack can be used 
with any framework and service combination, so as long as it follows the JAM structure.</p>

<h2>Top Front-end Frameworks &amp; Libraries for 2023</h2>

<h3>How to Use JavaScript Libraries</h3>

<p>To use a JavaScript library in your app, add &lt;script&gt; to the &lt;head&gt; 
element using the src attribute that references the library source path or the URL.</p>

<p>Read the JavaScript libraryâs documentation you intend to use for more information 
and follow the steps provided there.</p>

<h3>What Are JavaScript Libraries Used For?</h3>

<p>As weâve said, JavaScript libraries are used to perform specific functions. 
There are around 83 of them, each created to serve some purpose, and we are going 
to cover some of their usability in this section.</p>

<p>You can use JavaScript libraries for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Visualization in Maps and Charts</strong><br>
    <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/data-visualization-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data visualization</a> 
    in applications is crucial for users to view the statistics clearly in the admin 
    panel, dashboards, performance metrics, and more.<br>
    Presenting these <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data in 
    charts and maps</a> helps you analyze that data easily and make informed business
    decisions.<br>
    <em>Examples: Chart.js, Apexcharts, Algolia Places</em></li>
  <li><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong><br>
    <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/critical-rendering-path/#the-dom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Document
    Object Model (DOM)</a> represents a web page (a document) as objects and nodes 
    that you can modify using JavaScript. You can change its content, style, and 
    structure.<br>
    <em>Examples: <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-jquery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jQuery</a>,
    Umbrella JS</em></li>
  <li><strong>Data Handling</strong><br>
    With the enormous amounts of data that businesses now deal with daily, handling 
    and managing them properly is essential. Using a JavaScript library makes it 
    easier to handle a document following its content while adding more interactivity.<br>
    <em>Examples: D3.js</em></li>
  <li><strong>Database</strong><br>
    <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/adminer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective database management</a> 
    is necessary to read, create, delete, edit, and sort data. You can also use 
    sophisticated queries, auto-create tables, synchronize and validate data, and 
    much more.<br>
    <em>Examples: TaffyDB, ActiveRecord.js</em></li>
  <li><strong>Forms</strong><br>
    Use JS libraries to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-contact-form-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    simplify form functions</a>, including form validation, synchronization, handling, 
    conditional capabilities, field controls, transforming layouts, and more.<br>
    <em>Examples: wForms, LiveValidation, Validanguage, qForms</em></li>
  <li><strong>Animations</strong><br>
    <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-gifs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">People love animations</a>, 
    and you can leverage them to make your web page interactive and more engaging. 
    Adding micro-interactions and animations is easy by using JavaScript libraries.<br>
    <em>Examples: Anime.js, JSTweener</em></li>
  <li><strong>Image Effects</strong><br>
    Users can add effects to images and make them stand out using JS libraries. 
    Effects include blurring, lightening, embossing, sharpening, grayscale, saturation, 
    hue, adjusting contrast, flipping, inverting, reflection, and so on.<br>
    <em>Examples: ImageFX, Reflection.js</em></li>
  <li><strong>Fonts</strong><br>
    Users can incorporate <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/modern-fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">any font 
    they wish</a> to make their web page more compelling based on the content type.<br>
    <em>Examples: typeface.js</em></li>
  <li><strong>Math and String Functions</strong><br>
    Adding mathematical expressions, date, time, and strings can be tricky. For 
    example, a date consists of many formats, slashes, and dots to make things complex 
    for you. The same holds when it comes to matrices and vectors.<br>
    Use JavaScript libraries to simplify these complexities in addition to manipulating 
    and handling URLs effortlessly.<br>
    <em>Examples: Date.js, Sylvester, JavaScript URL Library</em></li>
  <li><strong>User Interface and Its Components</strong><br>
    You can provide a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/website-usability-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    better user experience</a> via web pages by making them more responsive and 
    dynamic, decreasing the number of DOM operations, boosting page speed, and so
    forth.<br>
    <em>Examples: ReactJS, Glimmer.js</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And those are just the most common use cases. Other uses of JavaScript libraries 
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a custom dialog box,</li>
  <li>Creating keyboard shortcuts,</li>
  <li>Switching platforms,</li>
  <li>Creating rounded corners,</li>
  <li>Affecting data retrieval/AJAX,</li>
  <li>Aligning page layouts,</li>
  <li>Creating navigation and routing,</li>
  <li>Logging and debugging,</li>
  <li>And many more.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following segment of this article is dedicated entirely to the
frameworks themselves. The list goes down in accordance with the
rankings we saw earlier. I have provided a general overview of each of
the frameworks, as well as links to GitHub and the framework's
website.</p>

<h2>#01 â React</h2>

<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React.js</a> (also known as ReactJS or
React) is an open-source, front-end JavaScript library. It was created
in 2013 by Jordan Walke, who works at Facebook as a software engineer.</p>

<p>React continues to dominate the front-end space. The framework stands
out with its own virtual DOM, ensuring persistent app performance at
scale. Likewise, the component-based structure means that development is
more accessible across teams.</p>

<p>While the learning curve for React is moderately forgiving, the
accessibility of tooling makes the process manageable. Namely, <a
href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create-react-app</a> automates
the build process for an application boilerplate. And then there are <a
href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React DevTools</a>,
providing an accessible debugging experience from the browser.</p>

<p>Thanks to the mass adoption of React, front-end developers can enjoy
getting their hands on many open-source projects. For example, more than
a dozen full-scale design systems are <a
href="https://stackdiary.com/react-component-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built for
React</a>. The number of hours this saves from the development process
can be enormous.</p>

<h3>17 React UI Frameworks</h3>

<h4><strong><a href="https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
1. Next.js </a><u> â </u></strong></h4>

<p>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use 
React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features 
and optimizations.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling
needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to
focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.</p>

<p>Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can
help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.turing.com/blog/react-ui-frameworks-for-developers/#material" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
2. Material Kit React</a><u> â </u></strong></h4>

<p>This feature enables you to maintain a similarity of appearance and functions 
in your project throughout. The layout is like that of multiple sheets of paper, 
giving it depth and order.</p>

<p>The Kit also includes several basic elements like sliders and buttons,
badges, pagination, bars for navigation, menu, pills, and tabs among
others. With the help of this React component library, you can customize
the style, size, and color of most elements.</p>

<p>The JavaScript elements have modals, date-time pickers, tooltips,
popovers, and carousels. You can not only use the Kit to start a new
project but also restyle any old Bootstrap project. Whatâs more, the
Material Kit React Pro version comes equipped with several other

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
3. Storybook</a><u> â </u></strong></h4>

<p>It is more like an <a href="https://www.turing.com/blog/7-popular-open-source-tools-to-checkout-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
open-source tool</a> that is used for building UI components in isolation for React 
and several other platforms and technologies.</p>

<p>Whatâs unique about Storybook? It enables you to work on a single
component at a given time, making the development process a lot
faster.</p>

<p>As one of the best UI frameworks for React, Storybook enables you to
document components for reuse. It also allows you to automatically test
your components visually in order to prevent bugs. Last but not least,
an ecosystem of add-ons allows you to fine-tune responsive layouts,
verify accessibility, and much more.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.turing.com/blog/react-ui-frameworks-for-developers/#boostrap" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
4. React Bootstrap</a><u> - </u></strong></h4>

<p>A significant feature of React Bootstrap CSS is compatibility, i.e.,
Bootstrap core compatibility and the worldâs largest UI ecosystem
compatibility. The framework has great compatibility with the hundreds
of Bootstrap themes used by developers around the world.</p>

<p>The React Bootstrap eliminates the need for Bootstrap.js and jQuery
dependencies in the code. React developers can even import individual
components from the library. This feature results in faster development,
shorter time to code, less code, better stability, and efficient code
management,</p>

<p>This UI framework allows you to build your projects on the backend and
then finally prototype them on the front end. And so, React Bootstrap
can be a great pick for developers working on multiple aspects of apps.
However, backend developers may not like the layout of the interface.
This is because the use of reducers and actions replicates a front-end
environment. And so, developers will need to alter their code or refer
to the UIâs documentation to get used to it.</p>

<h4><strong><a
href="https://www.turing.com/blog/react-ui-frameworks-for-developers/#admin"

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.turing.com/blog/react-ui-frameworks-for-developers/#toolbox" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
6. React Toolbox</a><u> - </u></strong></h4>

<p>React Toolbox is a React UI components library. This library can be
used to implement Googleâs Material Design principles in projects. React
Toolbox uses CSS modules for this implementation. Although you can
utilize any module bundler, React Toolbox integrates with webpack
workflow seamlessly. Whatâs more, the React Toolbox team provides an
in-browser editor where developers can play with components in real
time.</p>

<p>You can import components in raw components or bundles while working
with this library. The main difference is that for the latter, the
components come with all required dependencies and themes injected for
you.</p>

<p>In other words, the CSS for each dependency will be available in your
final CSS automatically and raw components donât include any CSS. This
means that you will need to provide a theme via properties to the
component for it to be properly styled.</p>

<h5>Features and benefits:</h5>

<p>If you are working on an application that is data-heavy in the front
end, React Virtualized should be your choice. Virtualized has a set of
reusable, lightweight components that can render large datasets
efficiently.</p>

<p>One of the most useful features of React Virtualized is that it uses
windowing and virtualization techniques to optimize the rendering of
large lists, tables, and grids. It is great for the performance of your
application as it only renders the elements that are visible on the
screen instead of all the elements at once.</p>

<p>Another benefit of React Virtualized is that it provides a set of helper
functions and utilities to assist with common UI patterns, such as
infinite scrolling, dynamic row and column sizing, and responsive
design. It supports both fixed and variable row heights, and it provides
a flexible API for customizing the behavior and appearance of its
components.</p>

<p>React Router is a popular compact library for React. It allows
developers to build single-page applications with dynamic, client-side
routing. React Router is designed to work seamlessly with React, and it
allows developers to declaratively define the routes of their
applications using JSX. This makes it easy to create complex and
hierarchical navigational structures within a single-page
application.</p>

<p>One of the key benefits of using React Router is its ability to perform <a
href="https://www.turing.com/kb/how-to-split-bundle-using-code-splitting-in-reactjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code
splitting</a>, which allows developers to load only the necessary components for 
a given route, reducing the initial loading time of the application and improving 
performance.</p>

<p>Another benefit of React Router is its support for managing the browserâs history, 
which enables users to navigate through the application using the browserâs back and 
forward buttons.</p>

<h3>Basic Overview: Using jQuery UI on a Web Page</h3>

<p>Next, open up index.html from the downloaded zip in a text editor.
You'll see that it references your theme, jQuery, and jQuery UI.</p>

<p>Generally, you'll need to include these three files on any page to use
the jQuery UI widgets and interactions:</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery-ui.min.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="external/jquery/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery-ui.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p><a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js</a></p>

<p>Once you've included the necessary files, you can add some jQuery
widgets to your page. For example, to make a datepicker widget, you'll
add a text input element to your page and then call .datepicker() on it.
Like this:</p>

<h4>HTML:</h4>

<pre>&lt;input type="text" name="date" id="date"&gt;</pre>

<h4>JavaScript:</h4>

<pre>$( "#date" ).datepicker();</pre>

<p>While Angular retains a rather large usage percentage, the interest in the framework 
is at an all-time low. Who knows, maybe the loyal following is because Angular 
is based on TypeScript? I'm just kidding, of course.</p>

<p>Angular provides quite a lot of flexibility for building SPA - 
<a href="https://blog.angular-university.io/why-a-single-page-application-what-are-the-benefits-what-is-a-spa/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Single Page Applications</a>. Similar to other prominent front-end frameworks,
Angular implements a Components-based development workflow. And, adds the 
Templates system - which manages the dynamic nature of the components.</p>

<p>Above all, Angular can and is being used to build apps for all platforms simultaneously. 
Code can be reused to be implemented in web apps, mobile projects, as well as native 
desktop applications. As for performance - it is <a href="https://github.com/ganatan/angular-ssr" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimized through SSR and Web Workers</a>.</p>

<p>Is it easy to get started with Angular? Not exactly. In fact, if we look at 
the survey data - satisfaction with this framework has also plummeted greatly. 
And the main reason is the learning curve, among personal preferences.</p>

<p>Vue remains a solid choice for truly modern web development.
The <em>progressive</em> framework has <a
href="https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-as-the-new-default.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently
pushed forward its Vue 3 release</a>. And, thanks to new features and
improvements, aims to cement itself as the go-to framework to build on
the modern stack.</p>

<p>The new release brings about some long-awaited implementations.
Including a new build toolchain utilizing Vite. Improved management of
state through Pinia. And a completely revamped documentation, which has
piles upon piles of tutorials to get you started.</p>

<p>As for its popularity, Vue excels at being flexible. The framework
doesn't impose a strict routine but rather lets you decide on what you
want to build.</p>

<p>For example, <a
href="https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can
structure Web Components</a> that can be reused in other development
stacks, including most basic HTML templates. Additionally, Vue is often
used to work on robust SPA projects due to native tooling, including
- <a href="https://bholmes.dev/blog/spas-clientside-routing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSR</a>,
DevTools, support for TypeScript, and testing tools.</p>

<p>So, what's the deal with Svelte? The framework has seen quite a bit
of adoption lately and even had <a
href="https://stackdiary.com/free-hosting-for-developers/#vercel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a> invest
in <a
href="https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-welcomes-rich-harris-creator-of-svelte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its
creator Rich Harris</a>. Fundamentally, Svelte works just like any other
component-driven framework. You build components that are then used to
structure the UI of your applications.</p>

<p>The main difference in comparison to frameworks like React is that
Svelte does not need to be shipped to the browser in its entirety.
Instead, Svelte apps must be compiled, which will bundle your components
into a pre-made JavaScript file.</p>

<p>Whereas other frameworks use the <a
href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual DOM</a> to
render changes, Svelte compiles applications with <a
href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their DOM
node pre-assigned</a>. This approach has lasting performance
benefits, <a
href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/introducing-svelte-comparing-with-react-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as
showcased by Josh Collinsworth</a>. And lastly, Svelte is quite
compatible with native HTML code and doesn't impose a strict
structure.</p>

<p>Which is ideal for fast front-end development. Here is an example:</p>

<p>// Example.svelte</p>

<details>
  <summary>Svelte</summary>

<pre>&lt;script lang="typescript"&gt;
  export let name = 'Svelte';
  export let textColor = '#000';
  function reset() {
    name = 'Svelte';
    textColor = '#000';
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h1 style="color: {textColor}" on:dblclick={reset}&gt;Hello,
  {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    h1 {
      margin: auto;
      font-family: Georgia, system-ui;
      font-size: 3rem;
      font-weight: regular;
      text-align: none;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;</pre>

<p>Meta frameworks have always been a thing. And, in this case, Preact
aims to be the lightweight alternative to React. If you've worked with
React in the past, then getting a hang of Preact will be easy. In fact,
you can comfortably use components between both frameworks.</p>

<p>The first thing to note is the bundle size, which is 4kb gzipped for
Preact, and 38kb gzipped for React. Likewise, the event system is
handled through addEventListener, so you can use vanilla JavaScript to
handle events.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a detailed case study, I recommend checking

<p>Ember goes back so long that it predates all the aforementioned frameworks. Sure, Ember.js 
might be seeing a lot less usage over the years. But, it's still a solid contender for productive 
app development using the MVC pattern. And, while the framework is popular among web developers, 
it is quite flexible for desktop and mobile apps, too.</p>

<p>More importantly, Ember remains in active development. And the 
<a href="https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-4-0-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Ember 4.0 release</a> adds new features to keep up with front-end trends. Another thing that 
makes Ember special is integrated backward compatibility. As far as frameworks go, Ember does 
an excellent job at making sure your code doesn't break with major changes in the framework 
itself.</p>

<p>SolidJS has been in active development since 2019. But, it was in the June of 2021 that 
the framework <a href="https://github.com/solidjs/solid/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener noreferrer">graduated to v1</a>. And since, has attracted a rather substantial 
following. At the moment, Solid has over 14k stars on GitHub, and there is a major update
every 3 months or so.</p>

<p>The framework is declarative and does not utilize a Virtual DOM. Rather, Solid is similar to 
Svelte in that it compiles components down to the actual DOM. As such, updating the state is 
specific to the code that uses it.</p>

<p>Lastly, SolidJS is heavily inspired by React. And, in many ways, there are quite a few 
similarities. Including the support for JSX, API for Hooks, and features like Web Components, 
SSR. Interestingly, it is also extremely fast.</p>

<p>A benchmark test <a
href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-solid-realworld-demo-comparison-8c3363448fd8" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concluded by Ryan Carniato</a> shows that Solid is 
able to outperform Svelte, Elm, but also frameworks like Vue and Redux.</p>

Web Apps with both simple and complex interfaces.</p>

<p>All the while, you get to work directly with Web Components. This approach helps to create 
components that don't add any extra bloat to performance. And the runtime footprint of Lit is 
extremely small. Simply put, a framework like React relies on JavaScript, and Lit only 
implements standardized web components.</p>

<p>Alpine.js is a JavaScript front-end framework for customizing UI behavior. And, even though 
Alpine resembles Vue and Angular, it's much less demanding on resource usage. The author, 
<a href="https://calebporzio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caleb Porzio</a>, 
calls it, <em>"a tap to close the hole between jQuery and React"</em>.</p>

<p>Alpine works best when you're looking to add interactions to your design, without all the 
overhead. For example, if you have a pre-built app design and want to add interactive menu 
dropdowns. Using React for basic interactive functionality is overkill.</p>

<p>Think of Alpine as the means to optimize your server-side web frameworks. In fact, 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22291523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
the author himself emphasizes</a> that Alpine yields a lot of its inspiration from frameworks 
like Laravel, Django, etc. Likewise, it's the perfect lightweight solution to add 
jQuery-style features to <a href="https://stackdiary.com/static-site-generators/" target="_blank"

<p>Qwik is a next-generation front-end framework designed to meet the
demands of modern web development. With a focus on performance,
scalability, and developer experience, Qwik provides a fresh approach to
building fast and responsive web applications.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Qwik is its instant loading, allowing apps
to load at any scale with no extra effort. This is achieved through a
unique approach to performance optimization that eliminates the need for
hydration, which can take several seconds depending on the complexity of
the application. As a result, Qwik applications are instantly
interactive, even on slow mobile devices, resulting in <a
href="https://stackdiary.com/website-speed-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a perfect Google
PageSpeed score</a>.</p>
<p>Qwik is also resumable, meaning that apps begin their life as
SSR/SSG, serializing the application's state and framework state into
HTML upon rendering. This allows Qwik to resume execution in the browser
where the server left off, without requiring any additional code to be
downloaded or executed.</p>

<p><strong>Moment.js</strong> is a JavaScript package that makes it
simple to parse, validate, manipulate, and display date/time in
JavaScript. It allows you to display dates in a human-readable way based
on your location. It can be used in a browser using the script approach.
Moment.js is also compatible with Node.js and can be installed via
npm.</p>
<p>You may find numerous simple ways to add, subtract, validate dates,
retrieve the maximum and minimum dates, and so on in Moment.js. Itâs an
open-source project, so you can easily contribute to it, add
functionality in the form of plugins. You can parse the date into the
desired format using parsing. We can also perform date validation.</p>
<p>Go to the official documentation of https://momentjs.com/ and
download the latest moment.js file available and then add the link
inside the script tag. Without downloading the file, you can also use
CDN link to run the code (see documentation).</p>

<h2>#33 - &lt;even more libraries/frameworks to come&gt;</h2>


<h2>Front-end Frameworks: A Summary</h2>

<p>Developers in the front-end world are facing a number of challenges
that are making their lives difficult. The biggest problem they're
facing isn't the complexity of a particular library or rendering
technique, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34218003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but
rather the sheer number of bad ideas that are glued together</a>. A
micro dependency system with never-ending breaking changes to glue
different tools and libraries together - that's not a great idea.</p>
<p>Using un-opinionated libraries that don't scale well is also a bad
idea. And some organizations are trying to stay relevant by blindly
following every new fad, without considering the bigger picture of what
the front-end space actually needs. This is just making the situation
worse.</p>
<p>But the good news is that there's one skill that is highly valued in
the industry, and that's tool selection. Being able to look at a tool
and imagine how it will behave in different scenarios is a valuable
skill to have. And sometimes, the simpler tool is the best one to
pick.</p>
<p>Developers have differing opinions on the use of frameworks. Some
prefer pure JavaScript, but it can get messy when the codebase becomes
too large. On the other hand, frameworks provide a disciplined approach,
but they can also take time away from fundamental skills.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, the front-end world is facing some challenges, but
the key to success is to have a good understanding of tools and to focus
on practical skills rather than just trendy technologies.</p>

<p>Today we're going to talk about Bootstrap.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bootstrap is a framework for creating web sites that's pretty popular among 
    web designers.</li>
  <li>It focuses on a responsive, mobile-first approach and what this means for 
    you is that responsive design is pretty much built in. And they do a really 
    good job of making sure that their pages look good on small screens. And then 
    build incrementally out from there.</li>
  <li>Bootstrap consists of;
    <ul>
      <li>CSS and HTML templates that you can use and reuse.</li>
      <li>It also includes JavaScript extensions, which is really handy, because 
        it is a way to add JavaScript to your pages, even if you don't know how to 
        use JavaScript yourself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, the emphasis for Bootstrap is what we call 'interfaces and layouts'. 
    It gives us this very familiar look and feel to sights that were made with 
    Bootstrap.</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of that, who uses Bootstrap?</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are a lot of popular sites that are or were built using Bootstrap. 
    These include nba.com, target.com, Walmart, codeacademy, Bloomberg, and 
    airbnb.</li>
  <li>If you'd like, you can even go to this website, builtwithbootstrap.com, to 
    see a list of different sites that use bootstrap. You wouldn't do that necessarily 
    just to go, hey let's go ahead and look at all the sites. Instead, it's a really 
    nice place to go to give you ideas for all the different layout designs that are 
    out there for you to use as a building block.</li>

  src="./images/image203.webp"

  title="Benefits of Bootstrap 3.0"
  alt="Benefits of Bootstrap 3.0."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>There are a number of benefits of using Bootstrap 3.0.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One is that it has a very handy 12-column grid system.
    <ul>
      <li>What this does is it helps with spacing issues. If you've ever spent a 
        lot of time trying to center something exactly in the page or lay out three 
        columns in a row and have them spaced out nicely, you know that it can take 
        a lot of time.</li>
      <li>When you add in the fact that this column system has built in responsive 
        design it makes it a really attractive option to learn about.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next, Bootstrap tries to include all the very common jQuery functionalities.
    <ul>
      <li>These include things like accordions, the drop up and down of content, 
        includes drop-down menus, and also carousels for pictures. It actually has 
        a lot of different functionalities, but I wanted to just mention some of 
        the ones that people just use the most.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, Bootstrap has that familiar look and feel that I mentioned before.
    <ul>
      <li>Many sites use Bootstrap, and when you use it,</li>
      <li>It helps make your site and any forms that you might want people to fill 
        out, look what we can call legitimate. It looks like a real site. And that's 
        really valuable, because it's important for people to have confidence in your 
        site when they go to visit it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  title="Why you should use Bootstrap"
  alt="Why you should use Bootstrap."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>So why should you consider using Bootstrap? Or at least know a little bit about it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>First of all, it can lead to really fast development. You can have a great 
    looking site up in really just a few moments.</li>
  <li>Second, it's platform independent. So it's going to look great no matter 
    what browser people are using.</li>
  <li>It's responsive by default. You don't need to do anything to make it look 
    good on different browsers. It does it by itself.</li>
  <li>And finally, it's customizable. It's one of those things where you can 
    like so many things about it. But if there's something that you don't like, 
	that's okay. You can go in and you can change the values to give it the look 
	that you want it to have.</li>
</ul>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 205. why you shouldn't use bootstrap (125) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image205.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Why you shouldn't use Bootstrap"
  alt="Why you shouldn't use Bootstrap."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>But there are reasons why you might not want to use Bootstrap.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One of the biggest complaints is that Bootstrap doesn't always follow best 
    practices. For the longest time, people have really stressed that we want to 
    separate content from layout in our webpages. And when you use Bootstrap, those 
    lines become a little bit blurred. And it's often very easy to see that we're 
    combining them.</li>
  <li>Another reason that you may want to avoid using Bootstrap is that it can 
    be very what we call resource-heavy. As I mentioned, it has the ability to do 
    carousels, and accordions, and drop-down menus, and other things with JavaScript. 
    And it has so many different entities built into it, that often times you're 
    going to be using more than you really need if you have a simple page.</li>
  <li>Finally, that look is somewhat generic. And while I put that as a plus 
    point one slide earlier when I said it gives people confidence that you have 
    a real page, if you're making your site because you're artistic or creative. 
    Or you want to show that you are really an innovative thinker. Then you might 
    not want to use Bootstrap. You might really want to head off on your own.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 206. what we will cover (126) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image206.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="What we will cover"
  alt="What we will cover."
  style="width:35%;" />

<ul>
  <li>When we talk about Bootstrap in this class, there are a number of different 
    ways we can approach it.
    <ul>
      <li>One is a supplement to your style, if you already coded it up and you 
        just want to add one or two things that Bootstrap can offer, that's great.</li>
      <li>Another way to look at bootstrap is to download one of their themes and 
        then you go on and you expand upon it or maybe instead take a little bit away.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, it's important to understand that Bootstrap is something that you want to 
use, not something that you feel confined by.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We're going to talk about the basics of Bootstrap. We're going to talk about 
    navigation and images and the grid system. But it's important to know that 
    there's still going to be many parts left untouched, that we can't reach.</li>
  <li>If and when you decide to go and use some of that Bootstrap code, just remember 
    it's important to test your code often when you are using something that isn't 
    yours. So, make sure you code a little bit, test, code a little bit, and test. 
    And I hope you remember to keep up that practice over this next week when we 
    start adding Bootstrap to our code. Thanks.</li>

  <li>The intention for bootstrap, again, is to always use the mobile first paradigm. 
    It's always going to bring up every page as if it's thinking, the only way people 
    are going to look at this is on my phone. If it's bigger then I'll make changes.

      <li>You want to make sure you plan for the smallest screen and then make adjustments

  alt="Custom, Iphone Retina."
  style="width:35%;" />

<ul>
  <li>First letâs talk about the smallest screen size that Bootstrap deals with. 
    It's kind of a custom iPhone retina screen. It basically deals with any screen 
    that's from 0 to 320 pixels.</li>
  <li>This is a kind of problematic screen size, and I want to mention it right 
    away because what I found is that students and myself will use a small break-
    point, but then it doesn't actually work on our browser. The reason for this 
    is that some browsers, even if they are only 150 pixels wide at that point, 
    won't return a number smaller than something in the 300s. This break-point 
    may never trigger for you. It's something to think about when you first start 
    coding. It's also not very common right now, so let's go on to the extra small 
    devices and phones.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image209.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Extra Small Devices and Phones"
  alt="Extra Small Devices and Phones."
  style="width:35%;" />

<ul>
  <li>In Bootstrap, these extra small sizes are referred to with an xs.</li>
  <li>Any device that has a minimum width of 480 pixels is going to be picked up 
    by that xs.</li>
  <li>Most phones fall into this category even when you're in the landscape position. 
    You assume the phone is at least 480 pixels wide.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  title="Small Devices and Tablets"
  alt="Small Devices and Tablets."
  style="width:35%;" />

<ul>
  <li>The next step up for small devices and tablets is referred to as sm for 
    small.</li>
  <li>This is any device that has a minimum width of 768 pixels. Now typically, 
    you would think of that instead as being between 420 and 768. Because the extra 
    small has those smaller screen sizes. But for generality, you'll just say small 
    is up to 768.</li>
  <li>Most tablets fall into this category, but you also need to remember that 
    from many desktop browsers, people open up smaller window sizes, so it also 
    triggers this viewpoint as well.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Medium Devices and Desktops."
  style="width:35%;" />

<ul>
  <li>For medium devices and desktops, we use this code md for media.</li>
  <li>This is any device that has a minimum width of 992 pixels. Again, Bootstrap 
    hardcodes these. And what I mean by hardcodes, is it says it picks a number and 
    this is what we're going to stick with.</li>
  <li>Now 992 is beyond this size of most tablets or phones. But there's something 
    I want you to realize. It's possible, that if someone's on a smaller device, that 
    they magnify their screen. It could end up triggering, this viewport. So, 
    somebody's on a small screen, but, they might be using the style sheet, of a 
    larger screen. And we're going to talk about how we can deal with this a little 
    bit later.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Large Devices and Wide Screens"
  alt="Large Devices and Wide Screens."
  style="width:35%;" />

<ul>
  <li>Finally, the last viewport is referred to as lg, and this is for large devices 
    and wide screens.</li>
  <li>Anything that is at least 1,200 pixels is going to be picked up by the large 
    break point.
    <ul>
      <li>Now I know that often the trend is towards smaller and smaller and smaller 
        when it comes to technology. But often this is reversed and you can see people 
        going for larger and larger. Particularly when you think of TV screen sizes. 
        It's important to remember, you want to code for everybody. The extra small, 
        the large and everything in between.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And again, even when you code and style for these large screens you need 
    to remember that sometimes people on smaller screens will trigger these larger 
    views. This happens to me quite often, because when I'm lecturing in class, I 
    tend to magnify my screen so many people can see it. So, these are the kinds of 
    little things that might cause you problems, because you don't understand why 
    they're being triggered. I'm hoping you can avoid them by knowing what's going 
    on there.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Now it is possible to change these default values for your breakpoints. 
    Even though Bootstrap hardcodes them, you can go in and change them.
    <ul>
      <li>You can either customize these values before you download the Bootstrap 
        code.</li>
      <li>You can go in and you can modify the Bootstrap's css files or,</li>
      <li>You can always write your own media queries to add new trigger points.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Now, when we talk about Bootstrap grid points, it's not important that 
    you go back and you memorize these exact values of the breakpoints that it's 
    not important at all.</li>
  <li>What is important is that you need to remember that xs stands for extra 
    small, sm is for small, md is for medium, and lg is for large screen sizes. 
    Because we are going to be using those four abbreviations quite a bit as we 
    start to code in Bootstrap.</li>
  <li>And, lastly, never forget that you can always modify these different break 
    points to your needs. What you can't change are those four abbreviations. As we 
    go forward make sure you've mastered these fours things and you'll be able to 
    really code and understand the things that are coming up.</li>

    excited to use Bootstrap and your kind of annoyed with me that I haven't 
    shown you how to do it yet. Let's get started with using Bootstrap.</li>
  <li>The first thing that you need to do is you need to get access to the styling 
    and JavaScript code that Bootstrap provides.</li>
  <li>There are three options for doing this.
    <ul>
      <li>We can download a copy,</li>
      <li>We can use an absolute reference to link to the code, and</li>
      <li>We can also talk about how we can link to the code from our CodePen

<p>If you want to save your own copy of bootstrap, you can go to the
website, getbootstrap.com, and there's a quick an easy get started link
for downloading. It is important that you use the official site when
you're grabbing your bootstrap code. A number of times, students have
gone on, searched the internet, and download older versions of bootstrap
and unfortunately, they are completely incompatible. And it takes a
really hard time to figure out where they went wrong. So, download from
the official site.</p>
<p>When you download, you also have the option of customizing the values
before you download. This will save you time, if you know there are
certain break points, colors, or other styles that you want to happen,
and you don't want to go around and overwrite them later.</p>

<p>Let me show you. When you go to the website, you can see that it lets
you customize different options. For instance, you can put in and you
can say how I want to use tables, forms, buttons. You can down further
and say you know what I don't think I'm really going to use any jQuery,
so I'm going to uncheck these boxes, and that's going to let me download
smaller amounts of code. You can go in and you can change the different
colors to what you want them to be. It's a kind of nice way to get
started if you already know exactly what you want to do.</p>
<p>For most of us though we're going to download the basic code. The
most important thing is that once you've downloaded that code, make sure
you know where you saved your files, this is so important you don't want
to spend time later trying to remember exactly where you saved it,
change your links, move things around It's very important to be
organized.</p>
<p>Another option, though, if you don't want that work of downloading
the code, or you want to make sure that you always have the most up to
date copy, is to use a CDN, or content delivery network. Basically, CDN
provides a way for you to use an absolute reference or a link to get the
bootstrap code. Down here, again, we can go to the link
getbootstrap.com/getting-started and they will give you the code that
you need to include.</p>

<p>I've got it right here. You will need to copy and paste this code and
this code into the header of your document. It's really important to
make sure you have the full thing because it allows bootstrap to know
that you're connecting through the CDN and you're not just spamming them
or trying to download other things. By including these, you no longer
have to keep a copy yourself. And that's really handy if you plan on
having many different versions of your site. And you don't want to have
lots of different copies of the bootstrap code.</p>

<p>I'm adding a third option to this lecture because so many of us use
CodePen. I wanted to show you how you can link the bootstrap from
CodePen, if you don't want to remember those extra links. You start off
by going to the settings, then the CSS, and add external CSS. You've got
an example here for us, where I am starting fresh. I don't want to go in
and put in those links, because I really want to keep this code clean. I
really want to keep it to just HTML.</p>

<p>If you follow along, I'm going to go here to settings. I need to
click here on the CSS. And, if you go down here to add external add,
right underneath here, there's a little something called, quick add.
Alright?</p>
<p>And, if you click on quick add. You can see that bootstrap is one of
the options. Once you have that put in there. As long as it's in here.
It now knows this is how you can add the external CSS. Now you may
remember that I said, you're going to connect to the CSS and JavaScript
files.</p>

<p>Once you added the CSS you want to click on JavaScript. Right here. Quick add, 
and add bootstrap as well. Once we've done this, our site is now ready to use any 
of the bootstrap classes or any of the bootstrap JavaScript that we may need to 
use.</p>

<p>It's very common when you're first getting started with bootstrap, or
even once you're a bit of a pro, to start with a template that's already
been created. If you go to bootstrap and you're following along in the
examples they have some example code there for you.</p>
<p>On CodePen I've included another example code, that's just modified a
little bit from the getbootstrap.com and I've put it in my Code Academy
Responsive Design Bootstrap Template. In my template, I did not go in
and link to bootstrap using the settings. Instead, I wanted to show you
this code both with and without the links because that way if you write
it up yourself you can still have it.</p>

<p>So, here's the link to the bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript, and down
here is my actual code, all right? It doesn't look like there's that
much going on, I mean, because there isn't. All I've done is put in a
hello world, how are you? However, if you've been coding for long
enough, your eye might notice that, the Hello, world and the How are
you, look a little bit different from the default values. Instead, it's
using that bootstrap font. One way is for me to delete the link to the
style sheet. I'll do that right here. And now you can see that the font
has changed a little bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 225. how do you know it is working? (138) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image225.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How do you know it is working?"
  alt="How do you know it is working?"
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>This is actually really important and let's talk about why. So, on a
simple file, like I said, one of the things you can do to test to see if
bootstrap is actually working or actually doing anything it to comment
out that link to the CSS. Right away you should at least see some sort
of very faint change in the font.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do, and I really encourage you to do, is to use
inspect element. This method is preferred, particularly as you start to
add your own styles. Don't forget, bootstrap is just one of the tools
for styling your page. The expectation is that you will still write your
own style sheet as well.</p>
<p>With inspect element, we can go in, look at the different parts of
the page and figure out exactly which styles are being applied and which
ones aren't. I'll make sure when we go through our code within the
examples that I often stop and use inspect element to show you what I'm
talking about.</p>
<p>So, as we finish up, this very quick example, I hope that you go in.
I hope you grab that CodePen example and you try writing one of your
own. If it's not working, don't forget that you need to include to link
that code in some way. You can use inspect element to see If there's any
styles being applied.</p>
<p>You need to make sure that you always include the JavaScript at the
bottom. In fact, I'm not sure I even put enough emphasis on that, so let
me show it to you again, just so you know what I'm talking about. I'm
back at our original template code. And I'll put back in the style
sheet.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 226. bootstrap template (139) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image226.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Bootstrap template"
  alt="Bootstrap template."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>When you scroll down, you can see that after I have hello world, I
have the template code that includes a link to some bootstrap code. Even
though you may not be using java script. Even though you may not know
how java script works for some of you. It's important to know that
bootstrap may be using the JavaScript in order to get things to work a
certain way.</p>
<p>This down here is a number one problem for getting to link to the
JavaScript. So, when you use, start writing your own code I highly
recommend that you use my template to get started every single time.
It's also important to remember that you can customize those bootstrap
defaults. I talk about that a lot right now. I don't think you're going
to do it. I don't think you should do it, but it's something that I want
you to know is possible once you really get the hang of what's going
on.</p>

<h3>Bootstrap HTML Template</h3>

<p>Finally, you can also always go in and overwrite those bootstrap
defaults. Remember how I said the font looks a little bit different than
what you may have been expecting? That's okay, you can go in and change
it in your own style sheet. That's something I hope that you'll explore
over this next week/module as you go in and you write code, and you practice,
and you write some code again. Thanks.</p>

<h3>Mixed: mobile and desktop</h3>

<p>The Bootstrap 3 grid system has four tiers of classes: xs (phones), sm (tablets), md 
(desktops), and lg (larger desktops). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to 
create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>

<p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for xs and sm, 
you only need to specify xs.</p>

<h2 id="Week3-05">Week 3-05. Bootstrap Grid System</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody. Today, we're going to talk about the grid system for
Bootstrap three.</p>
<p>I want to start off by saying, if at the end of this week/module (3-05), you
completely understand the Bootstrap layout system, you are awesome.
Because for most of us it takes at least two or three times of looking
at the material, playing with it and then doing it all over again, to
really get a good understanding of how this works.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that you'll follow along with me. We'll do an example in
one of the next modules, and then you come back and you read this
material again, and see if it's starting to really make sense.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 236. boostrap layout is based on 12-col grid (143) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image236.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Bootstrap layout is based on 12 column grid layout"
  alt="Bootstrap layout is based on 12 column grid layout."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Bootstrap can see every element as something you can break down into
12 columns. So, if you have a page, Bootstrap can take any element, and
say, oop, all right. There's a container, let's pretend I drew 12
columns. We can break it up and then you can tell Bootstrap whether you
want to place something here, or here, or maybe all three of these. Now
it's kind of funny because for the longest time people said never use
tables to layout the content of your webpage. That's breaking really,
some of those basic rules and tenets of content versus layout. But,
that's why everyone says Bootstrap uses a grid. It's not a table.</p>
<p>So, you kind of have to throw that practical reasoning out for a
little bit, if you're going to be using Bootstrap.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 237. 3 cols = 25%, 6=50% and 9=75% (144) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image237.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Bootstrap layout - 3 cols is 25%, 6 cols is 50% and 9 is 75%"
  alt="Bootstrap layout - 3 cols is 25%, 6 cols is 50% and 9 is 75%."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>With this table, we can basically say if you want to use three
columns, it's the same as saying a width of maybe 25%. Six columns is
50%. Nine columns is 75%.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 238. 12 columns is 100% (144) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image238.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="12 columns is full width of page or element"
  alt="12 columns is full width of page or element."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>All 12 columns mean you're taking up the full width of the page or that element.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 239. grid is 3 div classes; container, row and col-xx-yy (145) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image239.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Grid in Boostrap is 3 div classes; container, row and col-xx-yy"
  alt="Grid in Boostrap is 3 div classes; container, row and col-xx-yy."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Every grid in Bootstrap consists of a container class, a row class and then 
one or more column classes. The actual code itself is going to look like this, 
where xx is going to be the viewport size. And yy is going to be the number of 
columns that you want to use. Let's take a look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 240. setting width with col-xx-yy, #1 (145) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image240.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Setting width on col-xx-yy, #1"
  alt="Setting width on col-xx-yy, #1."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Let's look at our example. The class is always going to start with
those three letters, col. The xx component is the viewport size. It's
going to be xs for extra small, think your mobile phones. sm for, maybe,
those tablets. md for medium. And lg is for large. Again, if you want to
kind of think of numbers, you can think of something along the lines
about 480, 720, 992, and 1200.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 241. setting width with col-xx-yy, #2 (146) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image241.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Setting width on col-xx-yy, #2"
  alt="Setting width on col-xx-yy, #2."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Now, I promised you a while ago, you don't actually have to remember
these numbers. I'm pretty sure that I got them wrong myself. So just
remember more general concepts than the numbers. But you have to
remember xs, sm, md, or large. It has to be one of those four
abbreviations.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 242. setting width with col-xx-yy, #3 (146) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image242.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Setting width on col-xx-yy, #3"
  alt="Setting width on col-xx-yy, #3."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Once you've declared the viewport size, you can now say exactly how
many columns you want this element to take up. Anything from zero, which
means it shouldn't show up at all to 12 which means take up the maximum
width that it possibly can.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 243. col-xx-yy, #1 (147) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image243.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="col-xs-12 - extra small screen; full width"
  alt="col-xs-12 - extra small screen; full width."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>So, if you have an element that has class equals col-xs-12, you're
saying, if you're viewing this on a small screen, it should take up the
full width.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 244. col-xx-yy, #2 (147) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image244.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="col-sm-8 - small screen; 8 of 12 on smallest screen"
  alt="col-sm-8 - small screen; 8 of 12 on smallest screen."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>If you're looking at one that has a class of col-sm-8, now you want
to take up eight out of those 12 columns, but only on the smallest
screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 245. col-xx-yy, #3 (148) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image245.webp"

  title="col-md-4 - medium screen; 4 columns or 1/3 of screen"
  alt="col-md-4 - medium screen; 4 columns or 1/3 of screen."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>For col-md-4, you're saying, if I'm on a medium screen I want to use
up four columns or one third of the entire screen size.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 246. col-xx-yy, #4 (148) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image246.webp"

  title="col-lg-3 - large screen; up to a quarter or 25%"
  alt="col-lg-3 - large screen; up to a quarter or 25%."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>And for col-lg-3, you're saying, well this is a large screen, it
doesn't need to be as big as it was on those other screens. Let's just
use up a quarter or 25%.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 247. col-xx-yy, #5 (149) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image247.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="You may combine classes"
  alt="You may combine classes."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Now, this is the interesting thing. Many times you're going to
combine these classes together. Let's think about if you're going to put
pictures on your website. It's a very common idea to think, well on the
small screen I want one picture, and each picture should take up the
whole width of the viewport. But if I'm on a larger screen, well, then
maybe there can be three across, and on a different screen maybe four
across.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 248. col-xx-yy, #6 (149) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image248.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Four screen sizes in responsive design"
  alt="Four screen sizes in responsive design."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Let's imagine that I have an image, some sort of pic.jpg. And then we
have our four screen sizes. I might have my extra small, small, my
medium and it's not quite going to look larger but my large. When you
look at col-xs-12, that means my image should take up pretty much the
whole width. But, if I'm showing this image on a small screen, I only
want it to take up about half the size. That way if there's other
images, they can fill in next to me instead of under me. In the same
way, if I'm going to have a medium screen, I only wanted to take up
about a quarter leaving room for three other pictures. And then, on a
large screen I'm going to draw it really small just to kind of be the
side be like, I only want that to take up one sixth. It's the same
picture. It's the same HTML code. The difference is that, on different
viewports, the picture is going to look relatively big on a small screen
and relatively small on a larger screen.</p>

<p>So, let's review that grid picture but using the classes this time.
Right here we have nothing on there.</p>

  title="Using Bootstrap Classes #2, col-XX-3"
  alt="Using Bootstrap Classes #2, col-XX-3."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>But if I use col-XX-3, we're using three of the 12 or 25%.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 251. using bootstrap, #3 (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:35%;" />

<p>If I say col-XX-6, I'm using 50% now.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 252. using bootstrap, #4 (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  title="Using Bootstrap Classes #4, col-XX-9"

<p>Col-XX-9, 75% and</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 253. using bootstrap, #5 (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="Using Bootstrap Classes #5, col-XX-12"
  alt="Using Bootstrap Classes #5, col-XX-12."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>col-XX-12 means used up the full width that's available to you.</p>
<p>But what if you want two elements next to each other? For instance,
but only on a larger screen. Separate block, small screen. In line block
on a large screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 254. combining elements, #1 (152) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image254.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Combining elements, #1"
  alt="Combining elements, #1."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Well, what we could do is we can start off by saying, that yellow
part of our page, well, on a small screen, I want it to take up the full
width. But, on a medium screen, I want it to take up only three.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 255. combining elements, #2 (152) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image255.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Combining elements, #2"
  alt="Combining elements, #2."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>So, on here when I'm looking at a large screen, I'm only taking up
one, two, three columns. All right.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 256. combining elements, #3 (153) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image256.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Combining elements, #3"
  alt="Combining elements, #3."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Then if we add another div next to it, that div can say for this
orange part, if I'm on a small screen, again, I want to use up the full
width. But if I'm on a medium screen or bigger, whoa, well in that case,
I want to use eight columns.</p>
<p>Now, if you're following me, hopefully you are. Wake up, wake up,
you'd realize that 3 plus 8 only equals 11. I didn't use the whole
screen. I did that on purpose because I want to show you that it's
absolutely okay to not use up the whole screen. The second thing you
might be wondering is what about small and large. I didn't say anything
for those. I didn't mention them at all. Everything, since it's a mobile
first, propagates up.</p>
<p>So, if I define something for extra small, then by default it's also
going to apply to small, medium, large. Unless I specify something for
medium. And then that's going to override everything for medium and
large. You can really get away with just specifying one or two rules and
still hit multiple break points.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 257. bootstrap is mobile first, #1 (154) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

<p>It's actually quite possible to write even easier or cleaner code than what

  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Whenever you want to say something should be the full 12 columns and it is block 
already by default, it takes up the whole width. You can pretty much skip this 
whole col-xs-12 part. Bootstrap knows to do that by default. It says I didn't know 
you were supposed to take up the full width, you don't need to tell me. Instead, 
you can just specify those rules where it's going to change.</p>

<p>I've dropped the smaller part and this new rule now says basically any time 
you are on a medium viewport or larger, make it three columns.</p>

  title="Positioning Classes, #1"

<p>By default, Bootstrap is going to put things as far to the left as it possibly 
can when it's positioning them.</p>

  alt="Positioning Classes, #2."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>However, it is possible to add a push and a pull class on different
elements. If you have col-XX-push-YY. You're basically saying, hey, on
any viewport that's X, I want you to go ahead and push this element Y
columns to the left.</p>

  style="width:35%;" />

<p>In the same way, there's a pull. In here, you move columns to the
right. We're not going to play with this right now, but it was something
that I want you to be aware of. In the same way, I want you to know
about the responsive utility classes.</p>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned that you can have XX, or something like XX column zero, 
or really for anything, you can have column zero, hides it from the screen. It's 
usually a lot easier to use the hidden class instead. Hidden-XX basically says, 
make this visible on every viewport except for the one we're going to mention right 
here.</p>

<p>In the same way, visible-XX says, hide something. It shouldn't be visible unless 
I'm on this certain size screen.</p>

<p>The last one we have is sr-only. And this is a special Bootstrap utility class 
for screen readers. It hides the content for everyone, unless they're using a screen 
reader to access the page. If they are, then this element is visible to them, and 
them only.</p>

<p>So, we mentioned and we talk a lot about Bootstrap is this mobile
first idea and that larger screens inherit values from smaller screens.
I really think that the grid class is a great example for you to play
with it and see how they work. The idea that if you define something
from medium screens, it also applies for large screens. If you apply
something to extra small screens, it also applies for every screen size
that's bigger. There's a great site at Bootstrap,
bootstrap.com/examples/grid, where you can go through and you can see
some of the examples that they have coded up for you.</p>

  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Really important, do the math.</p>
<p>If you've got maybe a third grader or a fourth grader at home,
someone who's about eight to nine, have them check. Because one thing
you always want to make sure you do is that the columns that you want to
be next to each other, shouldn't add up to more than 12. Seems like a
simple thing, but it's very important.</p>
<p>In the next week/module (3-06) we're going to code together and do some work
with this grid class. I hope you'll join me and you'll get a really good
feeling about how this works with Bootstrap.</p>

Bootstrap Grid System. I'm going to go into CodePen and use this code so
you can start from scratch or mess with the code and play with it with
me.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 268. col-md-6 and col-lg-2 (159) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image268.webp"

  title="Bootstrap Grid System: medium and large; col-md-6 and col-lg-2"
  alt="Bootstrap Grid System: medium and large; col-md-6 and col-lg-2."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>As you may recall, whenever you want to use the grid system for Bootstrap, it's 
important that you put two kind of wrapper classes around it.</p>
<p>Here, I have my class = container, and my class = row. What I'm saying here 
is, it's time to look for those col-md-6, col-lg-2 different classes. And I want 
you to put these elements together based on being in the same row at times. I'm 
actually going to move this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 269. all four divs (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image269.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="All four divs"
  alt="All four divs."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>I'm going to a bit of a smaller screen to start with. And when we do this, we're 
going to go through and look at how the code works together. We don't even need 
to really look at the CSS for now, so I'll pull that out of the way. I have four 
divs inside here. Now, in each case, each one of these divs is exactly the same. 
The code doesn't change at all. You can kind of trust me on that one.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 270. extra-small, small, medium and large screen (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image270.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Extra-small, small, medium and large screen"
  alt="Extra-small, small, medium and large screen."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So, we're just going to look at the first one, and look at what that
code does. The first thing we need to realize is col-md-6 and col-lg-3.
How many viewports do we have right here? How many different distinct
looks are we coding for? At first glance, your answer might be two.
We're coding for the medium and the large screen, but don't forget,
Bootstrap is always thinking, mobile first. So, by default, we have an
extra small, maybe small view. This, what we've done right here, is
we've now made it so there are three distinct views. One, for the extra
small and small screens, one for the medium screens, and one for the
large screen.</p>
<p>By default, whenever we're on an extra small screen, and we didn't
say anything else, Bootstrap is going to say, you're going to do a div,
and you didn't tell me what to do. No problem. Let's make that sucker
full screen. We're going to by default use all 12 columns. So, that's
why this little div right here says, extra small and small screen. So my
question is for you. Why is it not showing medium screen and large
screen? Why isn't that information showing up? Well, it's back to those
Bootstrap utility classes. Down here, I have visible medium and visible
large. This essentially says, you know what, I don't want you to show up
unless I'm on a medium size screen, and down here, I don't want you to
display unless youâre on a large screen.</p>
<p>As we transition from smaller to bigger, this one's going to go away,
and this one will suddenly show up.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 271. medium view port screen size (162) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image271.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Medium view port screen size"
  alt="Medium view port screen size."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Let's take a look. Right here, I've just hit the medium view port
screen size, and a few things have happened. First, the div that said
extra small and small screen, it disappeared. It is now no longer
visible.</p>
<p>The second thing that happened is that the medium divs now have
become visible. We couldn't see them before, and now we can. But the
third thing that happened, that you might not notice unless you really
are thinking about it, is before each div took up the full width of the
screen.</p>
<p>Remember, we had four boxes, boom. One, two, three, four. Now,
instead of taking up the full width, we're only taking up six columns.
We're not taking up 12. So, we've really changed the look of this. We've
changed the content, but we've also changed the layout. So instead of
having four on top of each other, we have two pairs of two.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 272. large view port screen size (163) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image272.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Large view port screen size"
  alt="Large view port screen size."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Last thing I'm going to do next, of course, is go to the even larger
screen. So, in this next step, as we reach the larger screen, the same
type of thing has happened. The extra small and small divs, still
hidden, still not there. Can't see this one, can't see that one.</p>
<p>Now, the large screen information is visible and we've triggered this
rule right here. We've said, on a large screen, I want each one of these
divs to take up 25% of the screen, 3 out of those 12 columns.</p>
<p>And now everything is laid out in one big view. Hopefully, at this
point, you have a few questions. Unfortunately, I'm not right there to
answer them. So, I'm going to have to guess and maybe try to figure out
some things that you might be wondering right now. I know one that I was
wondering is this whole idea of what's with the extra space along the
sides? Each one of these columns is supposed to be about 25%, but there
is a lot of blank spaces around. One of those reasons is that the
container class and the row class has padding and margin around it. So,
this is kind of dead space, same over here. So we might be using up 25%
of the space, but that's really only from here to here, not the full
screen that's something that's important to realize.</p>
<p>The next thing that you may or may not be wondering is how I manage
to style, maybe the colors of the fonts or those borders around things.
Feel free to go in and look at all the code that I have here, not just
the HTML (see end of week/module for code). I'm going to pull my CSS back
over. And you can see that I have written some style sheets that say,
you know what, I want you to add a border but only around those classes
that start with the word visible.</p>
<p>And you know what? On any class that ends in large, I want you to
have it the red, any that ends in medium, the blue, etc., etc. With this
class, we may not do as many lectures as I've done in some of the other
classes. There's a reason for that. I want you to spend your time
playing with the code. Listening to me is awesome, I know it. But
playing with code may be ever better as far as learning things about
what you're doing in web design.</p>
<p>Play with this code, change things from visible to hidden. Go ahead
and put in different numbers to see what happens. It can be a lot of fun
to play with things, and make things, break them, and fix them again.
Good luck.</p>

<h2 id="Week3-07">Week 3-07. Bootstrap Navigation</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi, everybody. Today, we're going to talk about navigation bars.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 273. nav bars; combining classes to create a style (165) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image273.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Nav bars; combining classes to create a style"
  alt="Nav bars; combining classes to create a style."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Navigation is one of those things about Bootstrap, that's very familiar to people when they 
see sites that use Bootstrap. It always looks about the same. It works about the same. People 
are comfortable with it. The nav class is typically combined with other classes to create each 
different style navigation that you're going to see.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 274. nav bar; nav-tabs vs nav-pills (166) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image274.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Making a nav bar; nav-tabs vs nav-pills"
  alt="Making a nav bar; nav-tabs vs nav-pills."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>When you make a navigation bar, one of the first things you have to
decide is what type of links you want. Bootstrap provides nav-tabs and
nav-pills.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what this looks like on the browser. Let's  start with nav-tabs. The 
first thing I hope that you would look at and see is that it doesn't look very good. I've got 
the code. I've taken it from Bootstrap. I went in and I used the nav class right here. Change
that to yellow. I used the nav class right here and I also included the nav-tabs class. This is 
something new people haven't always seen, that you can use multiple classes within the class. 
So used it, looks correct, looks great, but I don't see any difference. This is something
that's going to happen to you. The problem is I haven't linked to the Bootstrap CSS.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 275. add css bootstrap to codepen (166) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image275.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Adding CSS Bootstrap to CodePen"
  alt="Adding CSS Bootstrap to CodePen."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Let's go ahead and do that now. I'm going to go into Settings, I'm going to click on CSS and 
I'm going to go down here to quick add and add Bootstrap. And as soon as I save that, boom, there 
you go.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 276. nav-tabs (167) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image276.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="nav-tabs"
  alt="nav-tabs"
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>That looks like a much more professionally designed navigation bar. When you use the tabs, 
it's supposed to simulate that kind of look you see in a file tabbing system where you kind of 
flip through.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 277. nav-pills (168) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image277.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="nav-pills"
  alt="nav-pills"
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Now, let's look at nav-pills. Here you can see that each one of the links, basically, has a 
different color. You can go in, this one is blue, the other one's are white. They all have that 
kind of same square look. The reason that this one is blue and the others aren't is because
I've added what's called an active class. This class in the first &lt;li&gt; says, I want to 
distinguish this link from the other links.</p>

<p>So, let's make it a different color. I can play with that code and I can change it, so that 
instead of having this link be active Got it? Let's put it here under profile &lt;li&gt; and now 
I've made the other one active. It's not really a big deal whether you're going to use pills or
tabs. It's just a design decision that you want to make a little bit early on.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 278. nav bar layout (169) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image278.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Layout of nav bar; horizontal, vertical, justified"
  alt="Layout of nav bar; horizontal, vertical, justified."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Once you've decided on either tabs or pills, another thing youâre going to consider is the 
layout. Do you want your navigation bar to be horizontal, vertical, justified? There are few 
different options and I'm going to show you right now how you can quickly change them. Let's go
ahead and just use the nav-pills code. When I go back up to that unordered list element, I have 
that it should be nav in nav pills.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 279. nav-pills nav-stacked (169) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image279.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="nav-pills and nav-stacked"
  alt="nav-pills and nav-stacked."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>What I want to add now is to say, you know what? Instead of being horizontal, I want to change 
it, so that it's vertical or stacked. This simple class completely changes the look of our page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 280. nav-justified (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image280.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="nav-justified"
  alt="nav-justified"
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Another option that we can use is nav-justified. When you use nav-justified, by default, it's 
going to take as many links as you have and spread them out proportionately. So here, because I 
have three links, each link takes up a third of the page. If I had five each would take up 20% and 
different things like that. Now the interesting thing about nav-justified is that when you resize 
the window, it actually changes the look of the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 281. justified to stak (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image281.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Large to small, justified to stack"
  alt="Large to small, justified to stack."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So now as I make it smaller, it changes from justified per stack. This gives a kind of really 
cool look without you having to do much about it. So, on the small view, you go to stacks. On the 
larger views, you're horizontal.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 282. drop downs; add bootstrap js files (171) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="Drop downs; Add bootstrap javascript files and link to jQuery"
  alt="Drop downs; Add bootstrap javascript files and link to jQuery."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Another thing you see a lot of people like to add to their navigation bars are these drop-down 
menus where you have different options, but some of the options have sub options to them. If you 
want to use drop-down menus, it's very important for you to remember to link to the Bootstrap 
JavaScript files and include that link at the bottom of your code to jQuery. So, letâs go ahead and 
take a look at what we can do.</p>

<p>Now hopefully, when we go through, you would think that when I click on the drop-down, 
something should drop-down and it didn't. I do this on purpose, because I really like to make

<p>So first, I need to know, did I link to the Bootstrap JavaScript files? I can check up and 
there's nothing there. I can check my settings and I can see, yep, I forgot to add the Bootstrap 
files. Save. I've saved it. I go down, it still doesn't work. What could be going on that where 
I'm linking to it, but my JavaScript or something dynamic isn't happening? This occurs a lot.</p>

<p>So while I haven't actually forgotten it as you may have, I did comment it out.</p>

the bottom. The one that links to jQuery, I'm going to save this now and you can see that now the 
drop-down option works. Using bootstrap is not meant to be difficult, but there are all these 
little tripping points. That's why I encourage people to add code slowly and incrementally and 
keep testing every few minutes to make sure that you're on the right path.</p>

<img class="displayed"

  title="navbar class"

  style="width:35%;" />

<p>The last class I'm going to talk to you about, with respect to navigation right 
now, is the navbar class.</p>
<p>What it does is it kind of serves as a navigation header for either just that 
one part or your entire site. When you use navbar, the positioning is very important. 
You can have navbarstatic at the top. Navbar-fixed to the top or navbar-fixed to 
the bottom and this is going to affect where your different, where your navbar 
is going to show up and how it interacts with the other elements.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 288. nav-pills and navbar class (176) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image288.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="nav-pills in navbar class"
  alt="nav-pills in navbar class."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Let's take a quick look. What I have here is that I've wrapped up my typical 
nav with nav-pills and I've put it inside of a navbar class. I said, you know what? 
I want to use navbar, let's use the default values and I want it to be navbar-
static-top.</p>
<p>This means put it at the top of the page and as people scroll down, you can 
see pretty much nothing's going on as I scroll back and forth. That's how I want 
it to be, it's just always at the top. However, instead of being static, I can 
go in and I can change this to fixed before I can even hit Save. I hope you notice 
that my content actually moved. I have changed the positioning of my navbar from 
static to fixed and fixed is what I call the annoying pop ad version of positioning. 
It means it's on top, it's not going to move.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 289. responsive design: navbar (177) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image289.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Hidden stuff under navbar in responsive design"
  alt="Hidden stuff under navbar in responsive design."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So, if I go back down to my screen now, you can see that it actually hides some 
of the other stuff that's there. I'm going to make my screen smaller. You can see 
I can scroll up and down here, but it's impossible to see the things that are underneath 
the navbar.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 290. move navbar from top to bottom (178) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image290.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Move navbar from top to bottom of screen"
  alt="Move navbar from top to bottom of screen."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>When you use fixed just be careful, the last option was to use bottom. And here 
what I've done is I've simply moved my navbar from the top to the bottom. But many 
times, with fixed content, this works out much better, because it doesn't cover 
up other things and at least take away the ability to scroll up and down and at 
least see them.</p>

<p>Back when you were learning about HTML, hopefully, you learned about semantic 
tags. Some tags are very generic div, P, different things like that. Other tags 
have meaning. Nav tag is one of those, it helps convey the semantics that this 
is a navigation section of your page.</p>
<p>Using a nav tag and a nav class are not the same. A nav class does not convey 
any semantics. So whenever possible, augment your bootstrap by using that nav tag. 
You can really just put it right before, close it right underneath what you are 
doing with navigation.</p>
<p>Another option is to use what is called an "ARIA" attribute where you can put 
role = "navigation" and it provides the same type of accessibility information 
that that nav tag will provide.</p>
<p>Let's go back, look at that code that I've provided, add some tags, play with 
the code. See how you can get your own navigation bar to show up on the screen.</p>

<h2>Demystifying Bootstrap</h2>

<p>I am about to go into some of the more advanced classes in Bootstrap. Before we begin, are 
you looking for another reference on Bootstrap? Ifound that this article did a nice job of 
showing Bootstrap classes along with the CSS that goes with them. <a

<h2 id="Week4-01">Week 4-01. Responsive Images</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 292. making images responsive (181) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image292.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Making images responsive"
  alt="Making images responsive."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Hi everybody. Let's talk about images. I think we've all been to places, where 
you've been on a website and particularly if it's not a professionally done website, 
some of the pictures are way too big or way too small or sometimes you'll see that 
even just when people send you an email. My mom does this all the time.</p>
<p>Hey, look at these pictures, and I'm trying to look at them and I've got to 
go scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll because the image is just so big. Since so many 
web pages now are made up of images, it's really important for us to think about 
how we can make them responsive. And we're going to talk about two different approaches.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 293. fluid measurements (182) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image293.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Fluid Measurements"
  alt="Fluid Measurements."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>One is to write your own code to do this, and the second is to use Bootstrap 
and some of the built-in Bootstrap classes. In your own code, it's not that hard 
to make your images responsive.</p>
<p>You just want to use fluid measurements. If you set that width to a 100% that 
means it's going to naturally change as people resize the window. You can also 
add a little bit of an element to that, however.</p>
<p>If you think someoneâs going to be looking at your page on an extra large screen. 
It's perfectly okay to add in an extra element called max width. This will say, 
you know what? I want this picture to grow with the screen size, or show up full 
width of the screen size. Unless, we're in certain situations, in which case, you 
still want it to be responsive. But you really want it to top off at 750 pixels, 
maybe because you think the quality of the image will degrade, or you just don't 
want it to have so much emphasis.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 294. min and max-width: 200-750px (182) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image294.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Set min-width at 200px and max-width at 750px"
  alt="Set min-width at 200px and max-width at 750px."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>In the same way, you can also set a min-width, where if the screen is
very small, you don't necessarily be proportional to the screen any
more. You really want it to be at least 200 pixels. When you go in and
you start setting the width on images, you might be wondering if you
should be setting the height as well. In general, you do not, because
what's going to happen is it's going to skew.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 295. set height auto (183) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image295.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Set height auto"
  alt="Set height auto."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>You can't get it exactly right. So usually, you just set the height to auto 
or leave it alone.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 296. bootstrap image classes (183) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image296.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Bootstrap image classes; img-responsive, img-rounded, img-circle, and img-thumbnail"
  alt="Bootstrap image classes; img-responsive, img-rounded, img-circle, and img-thumbnail."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Many people really like to use the Bootstrap classes with their
images, and that's because they provide a number of image classes, some
of them beyond the responsiveness that we normally talk about.
So, they do have an image responsive class. There's an image rounded,
where it goes in and adds a little bit of border radius to give that
image a slight curved look. You can also do image circle, where it will
take whatever image you want and only show the circular part. It
completely cuts off those corners. And then another one, you'll see
quite a bit is img-thumbnail. What this one will do, is give your image
the kind of look that is often associated with thumbnails. A little bit
of a border, a small size, we'll take a look at those in just a
second.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 297. img-responsive class (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image297.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="img-responsive class"
  alt="img-responsive class."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>But first, letâs take a closer look at that img-responsive class. What I've 
done here is I've taken a quick screenshot of what the inspect element says happened, 
when the image responsive kicks in. And as you can see, we have display: block, 
which simply means you can only have one at a time, the max-width: 100%, and the 
height: auto. This is very similar to the code we were talking about, if you wanted 
to put it in yourself. Let's look at those other classes as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 298. single image, no classes (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image298.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Single image, no class"
  alt="Single image, no class."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So, what I have right here is a single image in code pen. There are
no classes applied. I went ahead and I put it inside a div. And I'm
going to re-size the screen a bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 299. no response image (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image299.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="No response image"
  alt="No response image."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>That you can see my dog stays there, he doesn't shrink, he doesn't do anything 
like that.</p>

<h4>CSS:</h4>

<pre>Div {
  Width: 50%;
}
Img {
  Width: 75%;
}</pre>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 300. responsive image sizing (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image300.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Responsive image at 75%"
  alt="Responsive image at 75%."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>It would be possible for me to go in and do something along the lines
of image with 75%. And what that means, is it's going to take its width
based on the width of its parent, that div. So, if I re-size again. You
can see that the picture of Bacon is actually changing. This is great,
this is exactly the kind of responsive behavior that we want to see.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 301. responsive using bootstrap (187) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image301.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Bootstrap responsive imaging"
  alt="Bootstrap responsive imaging."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Let's see how it works, if we use Bootstrap instead. I'm going to go
in and get rid of that. Now, one of the things I've done when I created
this file, is that I linked it to the Bootstrap CSS, so I've already
done that step. So, if you're writing this by hand, don't forget to link
it in. Now, I can ignore the CSS part and just change the HTML to add
different classes. We'll start with image responsive. When I do this
one, you can see that now when I re-size it, again, great responsive
behavior.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 302. image rounding (188) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image302.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Image rounding"
  alt="Image rounding."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Let's see what those other kinds of visual ones do for us. We can have image 
rounded. And, it's probably barely perceptible to you, but you can have this little 
tiny curving, right here, curved just a little bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 303. image circle (188) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image303.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Image circle"
  alt="Image circle."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>Let's go for image circle, so you can really see when something happens. And 
as you can see, it really just cuts off part of the pictures, so you can have that 
circle look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 304. image thumbnail (189) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image304.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Image thumbnail"
  alt="Image thumbnail."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>The last one I'm going to do, which we can actually add at the same time actually 
just do it here, image thumbnail, hit save. It probably is hard to tell on this 
screen, but a slight border came out along here around this picture, you can't 
see it, and there is a little bit of padding and as we re-size the screen, you 
can see it is still responsive. Especially with that little red mark there, you 
can tell really well.</p>
<p>Each one of these Bootstrap classes is really simple to implement. 
And the reason they're there is because it's something people do all the time, 
so why go to the hassle of writing your own code, if somebody else has already 
done it. Well, we can see that there are reasons for doing that.</p>
<p>Personally, I would have liked a much thicker border, so you all could have 
seen it. But in many cases, you're really happy with the defaults. Let's look at 
one more example.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 305. grid class in thumbnails (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image305.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Grid classes and thumbnail"
  alt="Grid classes and thumbnail."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So, let's go ahead and look at this example, where I put together the Thumbnail 
class, along with some of our Grid classes to give you an idea how this would work. 
Up here, I have seven pictures of my dog. I just spent some time berating myself, 
because I couldn't add the seven pictures. I combine these with the thumbnail class 
to really have a kind of cool gallery effect.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 306. col-sm-6, col-md-4 and col-lg-2 (191) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image306.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Set up with column small 6, medium 4, and large 2"
  alt="Set up with column small 6, medium 4, and large 2."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So let me start by showing you the code. It's really simple. Kind of
quick. Every single line says this same exact thing. It simply, I give
the name of the file, and then I have class column small 6, that means
when I'm on a small screen, each picture should take up 6 columns.
Column medium four, each one should take up four columns and column
large two, which means each one should take up two columns. So, if you
do the math, that means on a small screen you should see two side by
side. On a medium screen, you should see three side by side. And on a
large screen, you should see six on each row. That's what was kind of
messing me up. I was trying to figure out why this extra picture was off
to the side. Well, I actually put it there because I wanted to show that
there were one, two, three, four, five, six. All right.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 307. mobile first example (192) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image307.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Mobile first in bootstrap example"
  alt="Mobile first in bootstrap example."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So, let's look at the small screen. Well, now this is interesting because I'm 
looking at it and nowhere do I say that something should take up all 12 columns. 
I said it should be six, four, or two so I should always have at least two pictures 
next to each other, and the question is why on the extra small screen is there 
only one picture of bacon staring at us.</p>
<p>Well, the reason is Bootstrap is always mobile first. So, it's always thinking 
about that extra small screen, even if you're not thinking about it. And by default, 
if you don't declare a rule for extra small, it's going to default for 12. So that's 
why on the extra small screen, you get one dog.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 308. small screen, 2 images (193) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image308.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Two images on small screen"
  alt="Two images on small screen."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>The small screen you get two in each row.</p>
<p>Then you go to three on the media screen image size.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 309. 7 images on two rows (194) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image309.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Container, row and responsive images (7) on two rows"
  alt="Container, row and responsive images (7) on two rows."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>And then, you pop over to six. That's the way things are going on
here. Have some fun with images. Images are always fun. People like to
see your pictures. And it's always nice when you can have that extra
little bit of style to them.</p>
<p>I hope you'll put your own pictures in and you'll play with your own
circle classes, rounded classes, and responsive classes. The important
part is to get as much experience and practice as possible.</p>

<p>Hi everybody. Today, we're going to talk about tables. Many people
use Bootstrap for styling their tables. I find that Bootstrap is very
popular for both tables and navigation menus. Because it's really easy
to go from something that's ugly, to something that looks really
professional. And it doesn't take much effort. However, using Bootstrap
to make tables, is an example of where you may apply many classes, to a
single element.</p>
<p>When we write our own code, we tend to make classes that stand alone.
I'm going to make this special class and it's going to style everything
beautifully. In Bootstrap, instead you need to layer multiple classes on
top of each other to get a really specific look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 311. bootstrap tables, #2 (196) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  title="Bootstrap Tables, #2"
  alt="Bootstrap Tables, #2."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>The table class, the class just class equals table, it's the foundation. You 
need to have that class every time you style tables.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 312. classes (196) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image312.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Classes - table and table-striped"
  alt="Classes - table and table-striped."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>Let's talk about that one. The simple table class it just adds some
padding and horizontal dividers. It doesn't sound like much but I'm
going to show you in a few minutes and it's kind of impressive how
quickly it transforms it.</p>
<p>You can also us the class, table-striped, in addition to the table
class. This stripes your table with a kind of odd and even look. Every
odd row has a little bit of color, every even row is just background
transparent.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 313. classes (197) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image313.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Classes"
  alt="Classes"
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>You can also add borders to your table where it will add a border to the tables 
and the cells inside the table.</p>
<p>We can also add a hover. This adds a hovering state so as you move your mouse 
or whenever you access the different rows it can change the look. It's also possible 
to have responsive tables. It actually sounds I think a little cooler than it is.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 314. responsive tables (197) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image314.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Responsive tables"
  alt="Responsive tables."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>How it works is that Bootstrap sets one breakpoint for responsive
tables.</p>
<p>By default, any table that's under 768 pixels, you can scroll back
and forth. It doesn't try to squish the entire table into one little
screen. You just kind of scroll.</p>
<p>But anything over 768 pixels. Well, then you're just going to get
that default view. There's no default scrolling at the bottom.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 315. row, header and cell classes (198) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image315.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Row, Header and Cell Classes"
  alt="Row, Header and Cell Classes."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>It's also possible to style some of the individual elements. Instead
of the entire table, you can style a single cell, part of a row, or part
of a header.</p>
<p>Some of those classes include active, success, and info. You also
have warning and danger.</p>
<p>Since these are classes, I want to remind you that they do not have
any semantics in it. A screen reader or anything like that, even someone
searching for tags, isn't going to realize that you're trying to put a
warning in there, it's just a class like any other class.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and look at an example (see end of week/module for code). I
really encourage you in this particular case to go onto CodePen and
check out this Bootstrap tables code from the responsive design section.
So, what I've done here is I've made a very simple table. I already went
in and included the link to Bootstrap style in CodePen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 316. tables and classes (199) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image316.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Using classes with tables"
  alt="Using classes with tables."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>So now, I'm just going to add some classes so you can see how it looks. When 
I add table class equals table, right away you can see wow, that looks so much 
better, all right? You didn't have to add any of your own styling at all. And now 
it went from just a bunch of text to something that really does look like a table.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 317. table striped (200) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image317.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Table striped"
  alt="Table striped."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>I can add in table-striped, and before I hit that D, I want you to look at the 
picture, and then look again. You're going to want to look at the Ashtabula, the 
Fort Myers, the Tulsa. It's going to be very nuanced, but you'll be able to see 
that it does look a little bit different. It was actually Los Angeles and Tucson. 
They have a little slight bit of color to them, while before there weren't.</p>
<p>How Bootstrap does this is it actually uses pseudo classes, and it does an odd 
even type approach to figure out which one should have color, and which one's don't. 
I'm going to add the table bordered. And actually, it's just table, yeah. I always 
forget. I'm going to be honest. I always forget whether it's table border, or bordered. 
Apparently, it's bordered. And once we add that you can see that it's added the 
lines in between.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 318. table hover (201) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image318.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Table hover"
  alt="Table hover."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>The last one I'm going to add right here is the table hover. When I save that 
one, again, it's a very gentle look. It's not something you see right away, but 
as I scroll between the different rows, there's a little bit of a hover styling 
effect. The next thing I want to talk to you about is the table responsive. It 
actually took me quite a bit of time to get this one to work, and I couldn't figure 
out what was going on.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 319. make table small (201) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image319.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Make table small"
  alt="Make table small."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>First, let's look at this table when I make the screen really small. Here we 
go, as I make it smaller and smaller it's just going to shrink everything down. 
I mean, there's not really much I can do for it.</p>
<p>I'm going to make it a little bit better and just to make things a little bit 
more interesting, let's add a little bit more content. That way we can see, well, 
maybe it didn't need to be responsive. There we go. Now I have a much bigger page. 
So, I'm going to save it, and I'm going to resize again. Now as you can see, it's 
just kind of squishing everything in smaller and smaller. Eventually, my browser 
gets a scrollbar at the bottom. But it's the entire browser, not just the table.</p>
<p>So, let's go back and make this bigger. If you add table responsive right here, 
if you do what I did and you save it and you make it smaller, still nothing happened. 
That's because if you want to use table responsive, you need to put this class 
on the parent container, all right. I'm going to go here, so I'm going to add the 
class equals responsive, oops, table responsive, to the div class.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 320. responsive menu scroll bar (202) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image320.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Responsive Menu Scroll Bar"
  alt="Responsive Menu Scroll Bar."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>I'm going to save it, and now when I resize it, at first, it doesn't
look very much different, but now, if I actually go to the table, you
can see it now has its very own little scroll bar that I can use to go
back and forth. So, it won't try to squish the elements too much. It'll
still make them pretty small, but you can see that if there's other
information underneath, it won't be spread out as much, so I can get
that scroll right up to I think I said about 768. So even here, it takes
up all the space, I don't need it. But that response is just basically
going to let people scroll.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 321. responsive table city/state (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image321.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Responsive table menu, city/state"
  alt="Responsive table menu, city/state."
  style="width:55%;" />

<p>I'm going to get rid of some of this extra ugliness for just a
second. Get it back to our old one, and then the last thing I was going
to show you were some of those special classes that you can use on the
elements themselves.</p>
<p>So, if I go in to this row, I can add class equals success. It
basically just turned it green. Nothing too important there. If I do
class equals active it's going to set it to, did I do that right? Yeah,
you can't even see it. It's barely even colored but it's there. You can
also do danger. That's your pink. And warning. Oops that will not work.
And in this one again you can see that it turns in a kind of yellowish
color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 322. should you use bootstrap tables? (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="Should you use bootstrap tables?  Usually, no"
  alt="Should you use bootstrap tables?  Usually, no."
  style="width:35%;" />

<p>I'm not a super big fan of some of these classes just because they're
so nuanced and hard to even tell. Visually, I think it'd probably be
best if you just wrote your own classes. But those first couple where
you have the table, you have the table striped, it's really great.</p>
<p>If you want to have more impact with your style, it's perfectly fine
if you write your own rules. Or better yet, get into the habit of
learning some of the Bootstrap classes. And then overwriting certain
elements of them with your own style. It's a great way to get practice
with both responsive design, CSS and just good coding skills.</p>

<h2 id="Week4-03">Week 4-03. Code with Me: Advanced Navigation</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody, welcome back to another Code with Me. What I want to do
today is take some code that you're really likely to find online. And
that's the code for using Bootstrap to make a collapsible navigation
menu (see end of week/module for source).</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 323. responsive tables (205) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image323.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Responsive collapsible navigation menu using bootstrap"
  alt="Responsive collapsible navigation menu using bootstrap."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>Let's take a look at what happens when we put it into CodePen. So,
what I have here is the HTML that's needed to make a really kind of
cool, collapsible navigation bar. It's the kind where it's regular when
it's large screen, but when you make it small, you get this little like
hamburger icon. Well, as you can see, this is not a good-looking page
yet. And it's not up to me to add the CSS, because I'm trying to use
Bootstrap classes. So, I want to walk through with you the things that
you would need to do in order to get this to work.</p>
<p>Now, if you were using an editor such as Sublime or Atom, you would
want to go in and actually edit the head of your document because you
need to remember to link to the style sheets. When we use CodePen, we
can just do this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 324. codepen settings for rd: advanced navigation (206) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image324.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Settings for CodePen to set RD: Advanced Navigation menu bar"
  alt="Settings for CodePen to set RD: Advanced Navigation menu bar."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>Settings &gt; CSS, you know what? I want to add Bootstrap, and I've
got it. As soon as I do that, you can see like, hey, this is a really
much better-looking navigation bar. I've got all the different
components.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 325. websitename (206) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image325.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="WebSiteName"
  alt="WebSiteName"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>And if you watch, as I re-size it and make it smaller, we get this kind of collapsible 
menu. People tend to call this the hamburger, because you have the three lines.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 326. 3 classes named icon-bar (207) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image326.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Three classes; all named icon-bar"
  alt="Three classes; all named icon-bar."
  style="width:35%" />
  
<p>Where do these different parts come from? Well, if you look right here, you can 
see that I've got three classes called icon-bar, icon-bar, icon-bar. That's where 
this little part is coming from. So now, everything looks really great. The problem 
is if I actually go to open it, nothing's happening. I'm clicking and clicking, 
and nothing's going on. This is just another example of why code snippets can get 
you into trouble. What we want to do is we need to remember that most of the interactivity 
on a page is due to JavaScript.</p>
<p>Let's go in and add that JavaScript code. All right, so I added the link to 
the JavaScript and I'm going to make it smaller, and again, the icon appears, but 
when I click on it, it's still just not working.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you use CodePen, it's hard to know what kind of links are working 
and which ones aren't. What I'm going to do right now is I'm going to take this 
same code I was using on CodePen, but I'm going ahead and I just changed it to 
use in editor instead.</p>
<p>So, let's take a look at that code. Right here, I wrote the code on my own, and 
when I minimize it, it's the exact same code. You can see that the menu bar opens 
and closes naturally. What I really like about writing my own code sometimes instead 
of CodePen is that it's also much easier for me to use inspect element to look at 
what's really going on, so let's do that for a second. So, I've resized it to full 
screen. I'm going to go ahead and show you the page source for just a second there.
I know you can't see it, I'll post it online. The important thing to know is it's 
exactly the same code.</p>
<p>And I remembered to include the links to Bootstrap, to jQuery, and the Bootstrap 
JavaScript as well. So, I have those three files. What I'm really interested in and 
what you should be really interested in is what's going on with these individual 
lines of code?</p>
<p>What do they mean because if you're going to use Bootstrap, and you want the 
coolest things, you find that it can be a little overwhelming at times, so let's 
take a look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 327. mobile view inspect of websitename (208) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image327.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Inspect Mobile View of websitename"
  alt="Inspect Mobile View of websitename."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>I'm going to start with the mobile view because I'm really curious
how this showed up. Why is this here when it wasn't here before, so if I
right-click and do inspect, I'm going to get my second window over here.
And it's really helpful because I can go in and I can say like there's
this button. This button that I want to look at, and right away, you can
see all the details. You can see the border color, the position, all the
things that you're really kind of interested in. But what I'm more
interested in is how does it change when the screen gets bigger? So,
I'll go back over here, make the screen a little bit bigger. And look,
right in that same general area, you can see that now it's displaying
none, where before, it used to have different parts to it.</p>
<p>So, this is my recommendation for you as you try to do advanced
navigation bars using Bootstrap.</p>
<p>One, avoid using CodePen and try to use your own editor to kind of
start from scratch. That gives you the power to quickly see if you're
linking to all the style sheets and the JavaScript and the jQuery.</p>
<p>Second, it's a lot easier to use inspect element to see which parts
are working and which ones aren't. Go in and play with the code a little
bit and figure out if you can change it so your icon is four lines
instead of three or two lines. It's playing with these little things
that's going to help give you the practice you need to use Bootstrap or
write your own code effectively.</p>

<h2 id="Week4-04">Week 4-04. What Are Templates?</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody. Many times, if you're talking to people who do web
design, you've got the people who think, I hate Bootstrap, and other
people are like, I love Bootstrap. Why is bootstrap so popular, and to
be honest, so hated at the same time? I think one of the key reasons is
because there are so many free templates out there for us to use. So, if
someone hands you a bunch of code, you're going to say thank you, and
probably use it. But that also tends to infuriate some people who really
believe that every website should be unique and original. Let's go ahead
and talk about some of those free templates that I'm talking about
because, if it sounds really good to you, I want to get you in the right
direction.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 328. where do you find them? (210) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image328.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Where do you find them? getbootstrap.com"
  alt="Where do you find them? getbootstrap.com."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>This first link comes from getbootstrap.com. These are just the ones that provide 
you when you first get started. These other two, bootstrapzero.com and startbootstrap.com, 
these are just ones I found either through word of mouth or through a search engine.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 329. that's it.  bootstrap template (211) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image329.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Getting started: Bootstrap overview and downloads"
  alt="Getting started: Bootstrap overview and downloads."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>Let's take a look. So here I am at the getbootstrap.com kind of default page 
where you can find out where to download, and where to get the different links, 
and things like that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 330. basic bootstrap template (212) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image330.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Basic Bootstrap template"
  alt="Basic Bootstrap template."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>What I'm going to show you is that if I quickly scroll down.</p>
<p>Not only will they give you a basic template for where you can start
your pages with a simple, hello world. They also include a lot of
different examples of other templates. So, you could click in and say,
you know what? I want this template right here. I want my site to look
like this one right here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 331. template using the framework (213) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image331.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Template using the framework"
  alt="Template using the framework."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>Or I really like the look of this one. And you can use it to build
very basic templates. Again, nothing too fancy, because the assumption
is that you're here to learn, more than to use as your professional
site.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 332. bootstrapzero.com - free themes (214) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image332.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Free themes - bootstrapzero.com"
  alt="Free themes - bootstrapzero.com."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>If you want to go a couple steps up, let's go ahead and take a look
at this next option. So here I am at bootstrapzero.com, and you can see
that, again, they're listing a bunch of free Bootstrap themes. They tend
to go in these general ideas of, do you want it to be a landing zone, do
you want it to have kind of a dashboard look, you can pick.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 333. landing zero theme - bootstrap template (215) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image333.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Landing Zero Theme - bootstrap template"
  alt="Landing Zero Theme - bootstrap template."
  style="width:55%" />

<p>So, if I clicked on this landing zone theme, I'm going to go right
here, Then, what you get is a much more detailed description of what
kind of things you can have. It mentions that it's built for laptop and
mobile view, as well as well as different views. It can talk about
different things that you use. Different keywords, we use Bootstrap and
the grid, and we use a form, and we have a video background.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 334. simple one page design - bootstrap template (215) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="Simple One-Page Design using bootstrap template"
  alt="Simple One-Page Design using bootstrap template."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>But what you probably really care about at this point is, what does
it look like? So let's hit this preview button right down here. And
quickly you can see what the page would look like on the different
platforms.</p>

<p>I'm going to resize the screen, and you go a little bit further down.
And they have that kind of drop-down menu here. Still have the video,
they talk about their reflexive layout. So, this is great and all, but
what do you with it if you really like it? What you do is they always
offer this download option right here. And you can download the code and
then start playing with it yourself.</p>

<p>The same is true if you go to Start Bootstrap where you can get other
themes and templates. Again, it's open source which means it's
absolutely free and you can use it. You don't need to pay them. You
don't need to do anything special. People like to help others and not
only that, they like the idea of people using their code. If you can
kind of mention it in your comments, give them a thumbs up, it's going
to help them become better programmers.</p>
<p>So again, they break it down in different ideas.</p>

<p>Do you want a blog page? Hey, let's go ahead and preview and download
that one. Each one of these elements are going to have things that you
really like about them, but they might have some things that you don't
like about them as well. So how do we use them? I mentioned that one of
the things you can do is you can just download the code.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Bootstrap templates. How do you use them?"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>But before you go across and you go, that one's awesome, I really
like the look at that page, you need to decide if the template is really
going to support your content. Go back, say hm, what are the important
parts of my page? What is it that I want to emphasize? You don't
necessarily want a streaming, cool video in the background if it doesn't
fit your content.</p>
<p>That's when you download the code. Find that template that's going to
work really well for you, download that code.</p>
<p>And then, you will need to modify the HTML. You'll go in, every place
they have the stuff about themselves, you're going to replace it with
the content you want to display.</p>
<p>This is why it's so important to understand at least some HTML and
some CSS even though there's free software out there. If you don't have
that basic understanding, you're really left at the mercy of other
people. When you know a little bit, it can really help you make huge
changes in the templates.</p>

  title="Bootstrap template. That's it!"
  alt="Bootstrap template. That's it!"
  style="width:35%" />

<p>The last thing you're going to with the modify HTML is add or remove
components.</p>
<p>If they have, like I said, a video, and you have no use for videos,
that's okay. Just take it out of the HTML. You can also take it out of
the CSS if you really want to kind of improve performance. If they use a
kind of layout where it's three columns, and you only want two, that's
okay. You can go in and just remove the parts that you don't want. If
you're feeling really powerful, you can also go in and add parts that
you do want.</p>
<p>So, using Bootstrap is really that easy. Even if you don't understand
HTML or CSS, or you understand JavaScript but you hate it so much, it's
still possible for you to create a really great looking site using
Bootstrap or really any other template at all. The thing is, I think if
you can use them but make changes because you know a little bit about
these things, your site not only is going to look so much better, but
you can be really proud of knowing that you had a hand in creating
something so great.</p>

<h2 id="Week4-05">Week 4-05. Interview: M W</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi, everybody. This morning I was actually ready to tape and my
interviewer didn't show up, but luckily, I ran into one of my old
students, Mike Wojan, in the hallway and he's agreed to talk with me
this morning about some of the things that he learned in my class, as
well as some of the things that he wished he had learned. So good
morning, Mike, and thanks for joining us.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, I literally work across the
hallway. It was funny running into you this morning. I'm happy to come
chat with you.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Great, so I want to just catch up a little bit. I know
you've had a few jobs since you graduated. I was really curious about
that first job, that kind of first job when you leave school and you
have some knowledge, but not a lot of experience. So what did you do
when you first graduated?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Sure, so when I graduated, I found a job as a User
Experience Analyst for the Information Technology Services for U of M.
And over there I was working on websites and mobile apps, trying to make
them easier to use for their main user base on campus.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, that sounds great, pretty much what you were studying
for, so that's unusual and wonderful. I was curious, and I want you to
be honest here. Your teachers can't teach you everything, so I mention
in web design in my lectures that you can follow along, but you don't
really learn anything until you get your hands dirty. So I was curious
if there were things I didn't talk about, because I know you took the
class three or four years ago and things have changed since then. But
when you got out there in the real world, what are things that you had
to learn on your own?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Sure, so I think what we learned in your class was how to
write HTML and CSS and kind of design really well, but sort of in a
vacuum, and so learning how to apply those same skills in the real world
was kind of a challenge. So starting out for ITS, I realized I had to
work on some systems that were pretty foreign to me, like content
management systems. Since they work on these websites that impact so
many users, they need something on the backend to help manage the code.
So learning that was tricky, but at the end of the day I realized that
the stuff going on inside that system, like the HTML and CSS that I was
writing, were the same things that I learned in your class. So it wasn't
too bad of a transition. Other things like accessibility are very
important, especially for the University of Michigan and its users. So
learning about accessibility and how to take this HTML that I was
writing, the semantic code, and take it to the next level that makes it
accessible by all of my users was a very interesting experience.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you took my class back before I was teaching
HTML 5. And so we didn't have a lot of those semantic tags. I didn't
know if now you're using header and footer and nav and just some of the
other tags that we didn't have back then. So that makes me feel better
that we're incorporating those now. Do you still have a personal
portfolio? Absolutely, yep, so my website as it exists today is actually
just an iteration of what I've built for your class for that final
project. So that was really cool to have a foundation to work on and
kind of turn my website into more of a portfolio showcase of the types
of things I do in the industry now. And that came in especially handy
when I applied for this new job because I was able to share some of my
work with them before meeting them in person.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; That's good, so do you code much? Is that what you're doing,
are you still coding or are you doing other things with people? You let
other people do the code and you're managerial and kind of, I'm really
curious what-</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; What you do when you leave, so.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm still coding a little bit. I still think it's a
lot of fun and it's really important to be able to have that background
in programming so I can speak the same language as the developers that I
worked with every day. Mainly when I'm doing development work, it's just
for kind of rapid prototyping things. I do have full-time developers
that I work with that do the heavy lifting when it comes to the coding
behind the scenes. But I'm out on campus, primarily, sitting down with
my users and figuring out what they need from these systems that we're
providing them. And then being able to come back to the office, take
that feedback that I got from those users, and translate it into things
that the developers can work on, that's kind of that heavy middle
ground.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, so you have a new job though, right? because
like I mentioned, I just ran into you in the hallway, I hadn't seen you
around. What are you doing now?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, so my first job out of school I was a User Experience
Analyst. Now I'm a User Experience Designer. And the main difference
there is working for this new department, the Digital Innovation
Greenhouse. I'm working on tools that are much more flexible and agile
and we're working on them iteratively. So, I'm able to go out to campus,
get this feedback and write cards for my developers to work on and we
can implement things quickly, gather feedback on it and iterate on those
changes. So, I'm doing much more design work now, so I'm kind of picking
up a lot of the visual design, the graphic design, trying to figure out
which color palettes and typography and iconography works for the
systems that we provide. And I think that's a new, interesting challenge
for me.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; That's great. It kind of brings up something that I hear a
lot when we hear about, why are so many developersâ men, which they are,
and one of the reasons people give is I don't want to do tech because I
want to be out helping people. I want to be doing things with people.
But we had talked, because you originally were a political science
major, correct? And you moved away. Do you feel that you get to interact
with people? And are you just doing tech or do you feel you're doing
more?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I still do the tech stuff. I still consider
myself a very technical person, but my main passion is working with
people. And I think the reason I transitioned into the informatics major
from the CS was because I still wanted to work with the human element
and I'm most passionate about helping people solve problems with
technology. And so, I felt that when I was just programming full time, I
really wasn't able to interact with the users like I knew that I should,
and so there is some middle ground between those two fields. And I think
that it's really important to be able to know what's going on behind the
scenes with the code when I'm sitting across from users. Because when
they give me feedback, I might know what's actually capable, kind of in
the back of my head, or what we're capable of doing, what's possible,
because I understand our code base. But I don't necessarily need to be
heads down programming all the time, because we've got people that do
that full time.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Because who wants to be heads down programming all the time.
There are times in life but not forever for me. Well, that's great. This
is what I was kind of hoping for is, I'm this face on this screen that
have been lecturing to everybody, and it's different when you go to
there in the real world. And I don't know if you were nervous about that
first job. I found that I'd done well in school but that didn't
necessarily mean I knew everything. And I like to encourage people to
know that when they're in tech, they're never going to know everything.
But it's these basic building blocks you talked about.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Of course, yep. It was definitely a learning curve starting
that first job after school. But I just had to go in confident that I
had that background that I got from classes like yours and I had the
skill set. And really after a couple of months of settling into that new
job, I felt like I'd really found a place for myself and proved myself,
and you just gotta take what you learned in school, and start applying
it. And figure out how you need to tweak those skill sets to fit in to
different types of working environments and it's really not as bad as it
sounds.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you very much. I do want to thank
Mike for this kind of last-minute interview. I hope you found it useful
and I hope it's going to inspire you to realize that whether you want to
get deeply into tech or just really at a surface level, it can help you
accomplish any type of job that you're going to go into. So thank
you</p>

<h2 id="Week4-06">Week 4-06. Interview: H W</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Good morning, everybody. Apparently, I am starting a new series
called high jacking my students in the hallway because I've just run
into another student, Heidi Wong. And what I did is I noticed that she
was working on some wire frames. So, this is a great opportunity to
again talk about some of the real-world applications of the things that
you're learning in this class. So good morning, Heidi.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Good morning.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you for doing this, I really appreciate it. So, you
were in my class last semester, correct?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yes.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; And one of the things I did as an assignment was ask
everybody to sketch out their website before we started designing. What
did you think was the importance of that assignment when you actually
did it and how much do you think your sketch really reflected what your
final project looked like?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Well I thought sketching was actually really helpful in
imagining the experience I wanted viewers to have on my website. Because
at that point, it was very early in the semester so I didn't really know
how to do very much as far as coding went. But I could sketch it's
pretty simple to think through how the front page would look, and how
the elements would be organized? So, it was helpful to lay that down on
paper, and then ask the questions, and talk to people about how you
would actually implement it in code.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I have to say, I'm very impressed because when you say I can
sketch, not a problem. Ask me to sketch something and I feel-</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Like I want to vomit. For me I'm a coder, I can create
things but that initial idea of drawing things out is paralyzing to me.
So, it's great to hear, I love to hear that that's what some people's
strengths are. And I love that the people whose strengths compliment
mine are out there doing the things that I'm not that great at. So, one
of the things, I just wanted to mention is I saw that you had these wire
frames in front of you. And just how often do you use them in this
job?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Pretty frequently actually. So, this is a new project I just
got put on. It's called policy maker, and it's basically this new tool.
They're designing for professor at the school of public policy, and it's
supposed to allow her to facilitate. So, every year the word school does
is list in class in simulation exercise. And currently they use these
tools to facilitate everything. And it's not really cut out for that
kind of thing, it's a three-day simulation where there's a lot of
communication and collaboration happening. And so, they want to design
this new tool that allow her to facilitate that process. And also want
the students to more easily communicate and collaborate with one
another. And I think when they introduced me to this project, I was
having a really hard time imaging everything that was happening. because
I have not participated in this process before, and so they listed all
of these tasks, they want it to accomplish. And I just not really
getting it. So, this is a sort of a way for me, to draw out the
different task that will need to get accomplished. For me this is more
putting myself in their shoes and imagining the different tasks they'd
want to accomplish within the simulation exercise. And just thinking
through their journey, through that experience. So, then I had something
on paper. And I was able to show it to my boss and does this look like
the right sort of experience that you'd want this tool to accomplish?
And then they can show it to the professor and then we can start the
conversation.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; So, you have a page there per project, do you have any
certain feeling of like how many sketches do you end up with?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Not really, I wouldn't say that I'm especially seasoned
either so this was one of the first projects where I've actually started
with the wire frames as a sort of thinking process.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Okay.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; So I wouldn't have the sort of definitive answer to that.
But I guess from me, I really like working through a very iterative
process where I'm constantly drawing, and drawing and showing it to
people, and if it's like not right then I can just drop it and go to the
next one. because that's one thing I sort of learned when I started
learning about how to prototype and wire frame, is that you don't want
to have anything too precious.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; That's a great idea, and I assume by that you mean, I talk
about it's so much better to draw it out by hand because you're willing
to accept those changes well.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Right.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; You want to be flexible.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Right, and they're very abstract too. I draw a couple of
boxes and they're all meant to be like this is exactly how it looks.
It's sort of here's the overall idea. Does this look right? If it does
then I can sort of move forward and we're find that further.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; So I'm curious just because it seems you're really into the
graphical, the drawing part, the sketching out. Are any of the HTML tags
kind of in your brain as you're doing it or are you really just looking
at it as separate parts? Be honest, it's okay.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; That's a good question.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I think it was helpful, it's helpful to definitely know how
HTML works. So, I feel like it's always sort of constantly in the back
of my head now, but I wouldn't say it necessarily informed how I think
about the experience.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Which is really great actually-</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Because if you're thinking about users, you should be
thinking about users, not about code. Well then one last question for
you just because I'm curious. Actually, it's not even a question, it's a
statement change to that. When you did your sketch for class-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Were you thinking about interaction or were you thinking
about layout?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I think I was thinking about layout actually. Because I
think for me, at that point I wasn't sure sort of scopes of interaction
that were even like doable. I think I have a much better grasp of it
now. But at that point, I hadn't even seen enough to know what was
possible. I didn't know if something was a jQuery thing or a JavaScript
thing or whatever.</p>

<p>So, I think I was just thinking hopefully out at that point.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think that's a really important idea, because when you're
first beginning-</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; When you don't know much yet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You do what you can and think layout is what we focus on and
I'm just really glad to hear that you've experienced this idea that why
are your friends are not just about layout, it's also really about that
experience.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Right.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you again, for stopping and talking to us and sharing
some of your work. Again, I just like to remind everyone that I'd really
enjoy the fact when I see students and I am fine if they are not doing
anything at all that I taught them. Because what I'm really proud of the
fact that they're following what they enjoy and they're using tech in
their own ways to interact with people. So good luck, I hope you enjoyed
this interview.</p>

<h2 id="Week4-07">Week 4-07. Interview with H N</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi everybody. Welcome back.</p>

<p>Today, we're going to talk responsive design with Heather Newman form
the University of Michigan. Good morning, Heather.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Good morning.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; How are you doing?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I'm doing very well. How about yourself?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I'm good thanks. Let's go ahead and jump right to it. What
is your role at the University of Michigan?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I'm Director of Marketing and Communications for the School
of Information, which is one of the 19 schools and colleges at the
University. So, I oversee all of the school's public relations. I
oversee all of its marketing. I oversee all of its communications.
Mostly for external audiences, folks outside the University. Excuse me.
And I oversee all of the websites and design.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, well, I'm tired just listening to everything you
do.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; And I'm also a little bit in awe, because that sounds like
it's a really big mix of both technical, non-technical, working with
people.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I assume a lot of independent work as well. Have you always
been part of the tech field?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I started in technology as a kid, right? Like many of our
students, I had a personal computer at home from age ten, I was online
from age 12.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; But actually, much of my career has been focused on text.
So, before I was in marketing and communications, I was a journalist.
So, I spent 20 years covering, and still do for some outlets, cover
technology and video games. And so that's been a large focus for me
throughout my working career.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, but let's talk specifically about the web page and the
different things you do. When did responsive design or responsiveness in
all these different platforms hit your radar, as something that you
needed to make sure that the Site was on top of?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Really from day one. When I first started at the School of
Information and the websites became sort of part of my purview, it was
pretty obvious that the site we had at the time had not been designed to
be friendly with mobile devices. And yet, our students, who are fairly
advanced, much like the students for this course, I suspect, were
already at that point carrying around smart phones. They were already
using tablets, which are classified as mobile devices frequently for
websites, certainly were at that point in time.</p>

<p>So, the experience that they were getting if they tried to look at
our site at that point, or any of our sites really, was not optimal.
They were seeing sort of the big websites shrunk down to a little, tiny,
screen and the outcome was that folks had a very difficult time using
the site and they would frequently abandon it as mobile visitors.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Really? What was your approach? I've talked in the class
about some of the different ways people can try to design from scratch,
or use different sites for mobile versus a single site with different
style sheets. How did you go about approaching your response?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Back in 2011, we initially approached setting up an entirely
separate mobile site</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; It would still draw from some of the information and some of
the articles we have posted on the main site, but it would be structured
entirely differently. sort of one of those m dot addresses, right? So
that people who came in on what we identified as a mobile platform,
would see that separate site that was tailored specifically for users of
that platform.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; And the reason why we chose to do it at that point in time,
was that Google would give preferential search results to people who had
specific mobile websites. Or mobile versions of their websites. So, if
you had somebody who was searching for you on Google, and you had an M
dot style website, that would pull up higher up in the search results
than if you had a normal website, that had a more responsive design.
Google's gotten a lot more sophisticated since then, so that's no longer
an issue. And what we discovered was that it was incredibly difficult to
try and feed a good amount of information into a mobile website. Without
confusing or frustrating people who knew that information was available
on the desktop site. But either couldn't get to it in the same way, or
they couldn't see everything that they could on the desktop site. And
there was no good way for us to sign post, to say this is the point
where you really need to go to the desktop to see what you're going to
see. So, we actually abandoned those plans even before fully
implementing the site. Okay, that must have been painful.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. [LAUGH]</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; As a programmer, I like the students to know that sometimes
you just have to chuck out everything you've done so fa,r and it can be
really painful for people to do that. And it's great to hear that's not
a failure, that's just one of design. That's just what technology is,
you know, going back and doing it again. So, you know, now you use you
know a more sophisticated approach. But still you know after you rolled
out, you know the latest sight are their things that ever surprise you
now or surprised you? When you had these sites up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, and we have a series of sites, right, we have the main
site for the school, but we also have sub-sites that address some of our
specific programs, especially those which are shared with other colleges
and schools on campus. So, we've had the opportunity to kind of redesign
with mobile in mind in a number of places, and it continually surprises
me what people want to do, so</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; As a school, at the university, for example, you can start
your application for the university via our website. It stuns me every
year to discover how many students want to begin their application to
grad school using their phones.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Knowing that I'm probably not going to write my essay on my
phone, right, but I want to be able to start my application in a way
that is easy for me to begin.</p>

<p>So at least I can get a sense of, these are the things that are going
to be required to apply</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; These are the things that I can start to ruminate about. Do
I need to include this in my position statement or my essay? And so, we
needed to support that as part of our mobile approach. And at this
point, all of our websites, I believe, are mobile first. In the sense
that our students, large percentages of our students and prospective
students come in using mobile platforms. Whether they're smaller form
factor tablets or whether they're just smartphones. But in either case
that's the form factor that we design for now, and the desktop is I
guess an additional version that expands on that. Okay, great. So, these
are exactly the kind of things that I love to hear about, because it's
so different when you're out there in the real world, and you're
developing these things, and you're dealing with failure. One of the
things I always hear from prospective employees, is teach the students
how to fail. And I was like, I can't, there are teacher evaluations.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; So, I guess my question for you, probably my final question
right now, is</p>

<p>I know that you hire a lot of developers, and not just developers,
but other people who you expect to have some level of technology
knowledge, or you know, understanding of HTML. For people who are not
computer science majors. For people who are not necessarily coming in
with a degree that's, you know, in design or technology specifically,
what kind of things do you look for? Just across the board for when
you're hiring people to work as part of your group. Really new people.
Kind of that first entry level job.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I think that a lot of, especially for that kind of entry
level position. What you're looking for is folks who have taken an
initiative to learn things on their own, right. Because they're not
necessarily going to have the 20 years of job experience to build up
progressively responsible positions that relate to technology. Or to you
know the websites, but if they can demonstrate that they've had an
interest for a while, in a particular area. That they're reading,
articles, journal articles, you know news stories that relate to
developments in the field, that they're doing things like this class,
right? To kind of advance their own knowledge. It's an indication that
they have an active interest and that they have the willingness to kind
of consume information in that field. To be honest, web design changes
on a daily basis, right? Every day there is something new that comes
in.</p>

<p>So having somebody who has a full suite of technical skills up front
is great. But if that person can't adapt and can't change those skills
as they move on. Then ten years from now you're going to end up with
somebody who is a whiz at ColdFusion programming and can put together
the best site based on frames you've ever seen, but they're not going to
be somebody that can adapt and roll with the new tech.</p>

<p>So, a lot of folks, when responsive design became such an important
priority for website design. A lot of people were used to designing for
the desktop. They wanted everything to be pixel perfect. They wanted
everything to look, exactly the same on every screen, and to be like
infinitely customizable, right and controllable. That, and some of those
people had difficulty adapting.</p>

<p>The more you can prove to me that you have the ability to roll with
those punches as they come, and the more you can prove that you're
excited about the idea of learning new things and applying them, the
more likely I am to consider your application.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; All right great. Thank you so much Heather, I appreciate all
your input today, and I hope that you've also gained something from
this. Whether it's understanding that yes, it's okay and expected to
fail, or really that any little thing you can do to get yourself more
engaged in tech is going to help you in all these different fields.</p>
<p>So, thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="Week4-08">Week 4-08. Bootstrap 4/5/6</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Hi, everybody. Let's talk about Bootstrap 4, 5 and 6. In this class I've
been talking about Bootstrap 3 exclusively. Those are the materials I
covered in the slides, and that's where the classes came from. But now
that Bootstrap 4 &amp; 5 are available does it matter? How will it
affect you? Well, just so you know, when Bootstrap 3 came out it
completely killed Bootstrap 2.0. There were way too many incompatible
changes. So, if you wrote your site using Bootstrap 2, and you tried to
convert or add Bootstrap 3 elements to it, it just didn't work it died.
Luckily for us with Bootstrap 4 they worked much harder to make the two
compatible.</p>

<p>They're still developing it, but I can tell you that Bootstrap 5 will
be one hell of a lot faster and better than both 3 and 4. They've
switched from a kind of language called Less to one called Sass that's
just going to be faster creating the things that you need. They're going
to include a new grid tier, so we had our extra small, small, medium,
and large. There's going to be something in addition, so it won't kill
the other ones. There are going to be new customization options. If you
remember when you downloaded Bootstrap 3 there were all these options
that you could add for things that you wanted to change. You can expect
even more in Bootstrap 4. One other thing I just wanted to mention
because I know that we've talked about it a little bit is that it's
starting to use more fluid elements or fluid measurements. It can use
rem and em units where before it didn't use them. And hopefully if
you've been paying attention through this whole class. If you get
involved in a conversation you can nod and say, yeah, rem, em, good
stuff, and actually kind of know what you're talking about. And that
always feels good when you're hanging out with techie people.</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning more about Bootstrap 4 or 5 you can
download the new code at this URL. v4- alpha.getbootstrap.com. Whenever
they're referring to software in alpha version that means it hasn't been
completely tested yet. It's safe for you to download, but there's
probably going to be bugs. The other thing you can do is you can follow
the blog as they talk about the different things they're adding or
deleting from bootstrap.</p>

<p>If you're considering jumping into Bootstrap 4, I think this is a
great idea if you really want to be a serious developer. It always helps
to be on that cutting edge in web development and really anything
techie. I hope what I helped you understand was that learning bootstrap
3 is really useful and you're going to be able to use it for long time.
Bootstrap 4 can only make things better, so if it's something you're
interested in, go ahead. I myself am excited to see where it goes.</p>

<h2 id="Week4-09">Week 4-09. Conclusion</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Congratulations everybody. I'm really glad that we had this chance to learn about responsive 
design.</p>

<p>Responsive design is really a key component to any type of web development you're going to do 
today. It touches on user experience, graphical design, coding, every single element. And that's 
hy I really like to keep it towards the end so people can get the most out of it. One other extra 
thing, that I also mention that people are even more excited about, is that responsive design can 
also affect search engine optimization.</p>

<p>If you do it right, people are going to be led to your page more and more. Also, I'm really glad 
we had the chance to learn how to use frameworks, such as Bootstrap. Learning how to do frameworks 
may seem like a cop-out sometimes, because you're not writing your own code, but it couldn't be 
further from the truth. You're getting great experience understanding concepts. You get to use other 
people's classes, experience linking to other files. Believe me, debugging your code when you try to 
use other people's code is not a cop-out, it's a really great learning experience.</p>

<p>So, what next? What should you do once you finish this class? Well, you should continue to practice 
your skills.</p>

<p>You now know HTML, CSS, hopefully you know some JavaScript, and you also know about responsive 
design. So, you can go out there and use your code from others, or from yourself, to create different 
looks for pages that already exist. You can also go out and begin your own portfolio. You really have 
all the knowledge you need.<br> Thank you for coming along with us, and I hope you enjoyed the class.</p>

<p>I think one of the reasons I find it interesting is that the CodeAcademy CSS tutorial actually 
uses a similar platform to teach about Bootstrap.</p>

<h3>Debugging your style with Firebug</h3>

<p>I tend to use Chrome as my browser, and Inspect Element to debug my site. However, here is a 
tutorial for another very popular development tool - Firebug. This video by Vicki Watson will 
walk you through how it works. <a href="https://www.ostraining.com/blog/coding/bootstrap-firebug/"
